For example, in disaster relief, healthcare, and\\ncyber security, where proper decisions are needed and the\\nchaos is considerable, the ability to control a situation inde-\\npendently is critical. Agentic AIs don’t just assist in human\\naction; they enhance it while taking on tasks that demand\\nhigh involvement and multi-tasking without constant human\\nintervention. Such a paradigm shift promises to expand the\\ntarget area of AI from being passive and reactive to focusing\\non strategic planning, information processing, and problem-\\nsolving, enabling a new era once the rights conditions\\nare met.\\n18912\\n\\n 2025 The Authors.

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nThe impact of Agentic AI [1], [2], [3] on society is likely to\\nbe considerable. As AI becomes embedded in more and more\\ncore systems and industries, agentic AI systems would be\\nable to work side by side with humans and take on tasks that\\ncan reallocate human effort, increase productivity, and engage\\nin situations where human presence may be undesirable or\\ndangerous. This change could transform job structures in\\nsectors, allowing for working in concert where AIs perform\\noperational tasks and people deal with more complex and\\nstrategic roles.\\nB. DEFINITION AND SCOPE\\nIn this sense, Agentic AI includes the class of autonomous AI\\nsystems [4] that undertake to finish a set of complex tasks that\\nspan over long periods of time without human supervision.\\nIt learns context and makes decisions. Such systems are\\ndesigned to operate with a certain level of autonomy, allowing\\nthem to traverse changing settings, deal with unexpected\\nsituations, and optimize performance over time. Tying them\\ntogether are the features of autonomy and adaptiveness to\\ncope with task-oriented processes. Unlike classic AI [5],\\nwhich is rule-based and requires instructions to be performed,\\nand generative AI, which patterns and generates an image,\\nAgentic AI features the best of both worlds.\\nIt is valuable to place agentic AI alongside current AI\\nparadigms to put its boundaries into perspective. For example,\\nclassical AI was never focused on image recognition or\\nlanguage translations [6], [7] but instead aimed at achieving\\nvery narrow goals.\\nThe first is how Generative AI [8] works. In reverse\\noperations, it combines pieces of information learned through\\nnumbers and creates content, such as words or images.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI surpasses the former two\\napproaches with goal-oriented, input-formed, and adaptable\\ncharacteristics that allow it to accomplish intricate and multi-\\nlayered tasks in a period without needing a set of instructions\\neach time.\\nAt this point of the survey, the focus is on why someone\\nshould be interested in Agentic AI. From its structural\\nand operational characteristics, why is it based on goals,\\nand how can that advanced type of AI be applied in\\nvarious fields where its application is unique? In addition,\\nthis article also looks into the various practical and moral\\nissues that arise from using systems based on such AI and\\ndiscusses approaches that deal with safety, transparency, and\\naccountability. The provided definition of Agentic AI allows\\nthe authors of this survey to discuss precisely what features\\nof this type of AI system distinguish it from others and aid in\\nits effective and integrated analysis.\\nC. OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTIONS\\nThis survey paper aims to provide an extensive collection of\\nAgentic AI knowledge and set its boundaries for easier under-\\nstanding by a wider audience of researchers, developers, and\\npolicy-makers. Key contributions of this survey include:\\n• A systematic review of the main elements that comprise\\nAgentic AI systems with an emphasis on how these\\nsystems differ from other commonsense and generative\\nAI systems.\\n• A comprehensive study of the techniques and concepts\\nused in constructing and assessing Agentic AI, including\\nthe architectures, learning approaches, and training\\nmethods.\\n• The current and potential uses in different areas,\\nincluding practical examples of the effectiveness of\\nAgentic AI applications in practice.\\n• Highlighting engineering problems but not limited to\\nthese: goal design and convergence, context adaptation,\\nand limited resources.\\n• A considers the ethical, societal, and regulatory issues\\nwith adopting Agentic AI, including relevant concerns\\nof responsibility, equity, and transparency.\\n• Recommendations towards future research, advancing\\nsuggestions on how the issues of scale, context, and\\nethics are best integrated into the implementation of\\nAgentic AI.\\nThis paper’s expected contributions are more than simply a\\nliterature review; rather, they should offer a useful and well-\\norganized background to develop the issues and particulars\\nof Agentic AI. This paper aims to provide important insights\\ninto managing operational practices and technological solu-\\ntions that promote and sustain the development of ethical\\nagentic AI systems.\\nD.

FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS\\nA. AGENTIC AI AND ITS ROLE IN THE AI ECOSYSTEM\\nWithin the AI field, Agentic AI serves as a different form\\nof intelligence that can take more autonomously functioning\\nagentic behaviors that are not limited to performing specific\\ntasks or following content-generating algorithms. When\\nviewed in an ecosystem context, Agentic AI stands out\\nbecause of its purpose, flexibility, and behavior, which\\nenables such AIs to operate almost independently. Rather\\nthan following strict guidelines like other robotic AIs,\\nAgentic AI systems are promoted to have rationalism in\\nthem, which enables each system [9] to reason and adapt\\nto different scenarios and such circumstances in a sufficient\\nway to accomplish goals. Due to its tendencies to enhance its\\nfunctions to prepare for any obstacles, Agentic AI has been\\nseen as a potential point of anchor for tasks and goals that\\nrequire high levels of interactions, for example, autonomous\\ndevices, collaborative robots, and interactive decision support\\nsystems in the areas of finance and health care.\\nThe increasing demand for systems capable of\\nautonomously handling intricate and dynamic processes\\nhas led to growing interest in Agentic AI, particularly in\\nsectors with a scope for AI automation. Though built on\\nbasic AI principles, Agentic AI increases the scope of AI\\nachievement by adding the elements of dependence and\\nadaptive independent action. The ecosystem of AI occupies a\\nspace between purely reactive and narrowly rule-based AI\\ntechnologies and broader ideas about AGI, performing an\\nessential function of enabling autonomous decision-making\\nwithin defined boundaries or structures. This unique position\\naccentuates the ability of Agentic AI to fit in scenarios\\nwhere the ability to make rapid decisions, manage over-\\ntime objectives, and learn on the go are fundamentals to the\\nproblem at hand.\\nB. COMPARISON WITH TRADITIONAL AI\\nAI, which can be described as ‘Agentic’ has its core\\ndifferences when compared to the other advanced types\\nof AIs in terms of autonomy, function, and scope, among\\nothers. Such AI systems are integrated into specific tasks\\nlike image analysis [10], translation of languages [11], and\\nrecommendation engines [12], making them able to perform\\ndesignated tasks in a highly focused but characteristic narrow\\nmanner and scope. They are mostly based on supervised\\nlearning approaches on really big datasets where behavior is\\ndetermined by the input and instructions given to them by\\npeople. Thus, traditional AIs are best applied in controlled\\nenvironments with limited ability to micromanage situations\\nand rather more significant outcomes.\\nOn the other hand, Agentic AI systems can be described\\nas possessing the characteristic of open-endedness where\\nthere is no prescription of how the task should be achieved.\\nThey work with and adapt to rapidly changing conditions.\\nOn the other hand, while conventional AI systems might\\nbe accurate, they do not have the situational awareness\\nand goal-directed dynamics inherent in Agentic AI. A case\\nexample may include a factory’s AI model that is developed\\nto predict equipment failure. As much as the premise is good,\\nAI will not incorporate adaptive shifts in the way it predicts\\nfailures due to factors such as changes in the manufacturing\\nschedule or changes in wear patterns across machines. On the\\nother hand, Agentic AI could change its metrics estimation\\nprocesses depending on the context and adapt both its short\\nand long-term strategies, which is impossible with traditional\\nmodels.\\nAs shown in Table 1, Agentic AI systems not only adapt\\nbased on real-time context but also maintain the flexibility\\nto optimize for complex, long-term goals. These distinctions\\nillustrate Agentic AI’s value in scenarios where conventional,\\nrule-bound AI falls short, emphasizing its transformative\\nrole in addressing the demands of unpredictable, high-stakes\\nenvironments.\\nC. EXPANDED COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL AGENTS\\nWhile classical AI systems are primarily rule-based or\\nsupervised-learning models designed for specific tasks,\\nAgentic AI integrates autonomy and adaptability, enabling\\nbroader functionality. The differences between these\\nparadigms are best illustrated with examples.\\n1) CLASSICAL AGENTS\\nThese agents excel in controlled environments. For example,\\nrule-based financial trading algorithms function effectively\\nwhen predefined parameters remain constant. However,\\nthey struggle with volatile market changes or unpredictable\\ndisruptions.\\n2) AGENTIC AI\\nIn contrast, Agentic AI-powered trading systems dynamically\\nadjust strategies based on real-time data, historical trends, and\\nunexpected market shifts, making them more resilient and\\nadaptive.\\n3) REINFORCEMENT LEARNING VERSUS\\nLANGUAGE-MODEL-BASED AGENTS\\nWhile reinforcement learning focuses on optimizing cumula-\\ntive rewards in a specific task environment, language-model-\\nbased agents extend this by interpreting complex natural\\nlanguage inputs and interacting with humans seamlessly.\\nFor example, an RL agent excels at optimizing gameplay\\n18914 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Table 2 highlights the key differences.\\nD. TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS\\nThe development of Agentic AI systems relies on core\\nalgorithms and frameworks that enable goal-directed behav-\\nior, contextual adaptation, and autonomous decision-making.\\nThese technical foundations incorporate advances in rein-\\nforcement learning, goal-oriented architectures, and adaptive\\ncontrol mechanisms.\\nReinforcement Learning (RL) [13] is central to many\\nagentic systems, as it equips AI models with the ability\\nto learn through trial and error. In RL, agents are trained\\nto maximize cumulative rewards by interacting with an\\nenvironment, adapting their actions to achieve specific goals\\nover time. This learning paradigm is particularly useful\\nfor Agentic AI because it enables systems to continuously\\nrefine their strategies based on feedback. As illustrated\\nin Figure 1, reinforcement learning supports ‘‘Learning\\nthrough interaction’’ and involves a trial-and-error approach\\nto optimize decisions over time.\\nGoal-Oriented Architectures [14] provide a structural\\nframework for managing complex objectives within Agentic\\nAI systems. Unlike traditional architectures, which often\\nfocus on single tasks, goal-oriented architectures enable\\nagents to prioritize and pursue multiple objectives simul-\\ntaneously. These architectures support a modular structure,\\nwhere larger goals are broken into manageable sub-goals.\\nIn the context of Figure 1, goal-oriented architectures\\nfacilitate ‘‘Managing complex objectives,’’ allowing agents\\nto approach tasks in structured steps.\\nAdaptive Control Mechanisms [15] ensure that Agentic\\nAI systems can adjust to changing environments. By incor-\\nporating adaptive control, agents recalibrate their parameters\\nin response to external variations, such as data shifts\\nor unexpected disruptions. Techniques like meta-learning,\\nwhere agents learn to adapt based on prior experiences,\\nenable greater resilience and flexibility. As shown in the\\nflowchart, adaptive control mechanisms provide ‘‘Environ-\\nmental adaptation,’’ allowing agents to maintain optimal\\nperformance even under changing conditions.\\nFigure 1 provides a visual representation of these\\ncore frameworks, illustrating how they interact to enable\\nautonomous, adaptable, and goal-driven behavior in Agentic\\nAI systems. Together, these technical foundations equip\\nAgentic AI with the structural and functional capabilities\\nnecessary to manage complex, evolving tasks independently,\\nsetting it apart from traditional AI systems that rely on rigidly\\ndefined parameters and instructions.\\nBy combining reinforcement learning, goal-oriented archi-\\ntectures, and adaptive control, Agentic AI systems achieve\\na level of autonomy and resilience that allows them to\\noperate effectively in diverse environments. This section\\nestablishes the technical basis for understanding the advanced\\ncapabilities of Agentic AI, providing a foundation for the\\nmethodologies and applications discussed in the following\\nsections.\\nIII. CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. AUTONOMY AND GOAL COMPLEXITY\\nAutonomy is one of the most sought-after qualities that\\nAgentic AI can possess. This is especially needed where\\ncomplex multi-goal scenarios are involved. Most tradi-\\ntional AI systems focus on completing one task and\\nare programmed with non-complicated input and output\\nrequirements to achieve that single goal. In contrast, systems\\npowered by agentic AI can move through multiple needed\\ntasks and shift from one basic one to multiple complex\\nend goals. Such systems come with a certain amount of\\nself-governance where continual supervision of a human\\nbeing is not mandatory, though at times preferred, and\\nAI agents function independently upon a predetermined or\\nevolving goal structure. One extra step does, however, require\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18915'),\n",

An example can\\nbe drawn from autonomous robotics [16], where such an\\nagentic system would demand the complete traversal from\\npoint A to point B, with the additional allowance of making\\ndiversions around the route, moving constraints such as task\\nhierarchy, time frames, energy expendable ratios, and safety\\nstandards. Such an understanding deepens the comprehension\\nof goal complexity, where high-order decision models are\\nused wherein goals guide analysis, planning, and action.\\nQuite clearly, then, as this enables Agentic AI systems to\\ncarry out intricate objectives that had been deconstructed\\ninto sub-tasks that could fit autonomously into an operational\\nstrategy coupled with adjustments.\\nB. ENVIRONMENTAL AND OPERATIONAL COMPLEXITY\\nMoreover, Agentic AI’s capacity to operate within varied and\\nchanging circumstances is yet another characteristic of this\\nAI. Unlike past AI, built for the most optimum functions in\\na constant and easily predictable environment [17], Agentic\\nAIs integrate all the variability in the real world. This\\ninvolves adjusting quickly to environmental conditions, data\\nor pattern changes, and even time-worn or newly constituted\\nuser demands. In the case of AI agents for self-driving cars,\\nthe ideal Agent Did not Photoshop to comply with artificial\\nboundaries contained in traffic laws alone but would learn\\nnew road designs and try to understand how the behavior\\nof other drivers would be before deciding how to act in a\\nparticular situation when the need arises within a very short\\nperiod.\\nTo do this, Agentic AI systems, as a general rule, are\\nequipped with means for environmental interaction, on-the-\\nspot data processing, and situational context comprehension.\\nThese capabilities allow the system to keep track of and\\nactively participate in the operational parameters that are\\nprone to alterations even at the last minute. For instance,\\nchange control [18] in Agentic AI systems is typically\\nembedded within the Agent as reinforcement learning or\\nadaptive algorithms so that the Agent can work optimally\\nregardless of the changing conditions. These characteristic\\nfeatures make Agentic AI fit for use in environments with\\nmany dynamics where reactions must be rapid, such as in\\nDisaster management, healthcare, finance, etc.\\nC. INDEPENDENT DECISION-MAKING AND ADAPTABILITY\\nAutonomy and flexibility are core requirements for the\\nAgentic AI to work independently for long hours. In contrast\\nto rule-based systems, which merely do what they are told,\\nAgentic AI has to situate itself in its current context and\\nmake decisions as it is working, so it has to learn over time\\nand improve on its behavior. This type of decision-making\\nis commonly done through reinforcement learning or meta-\\nlearning when the AI agent gets feedback repeatedly and\\nimproves its behavior.\\nFlexibility allows Agentic AI to act differently in the\\nsame scenario and pursue the relevant goals.

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nin a customer service situation, an agentic AI could change\\nits communication strategies to those that work best with\\ncustomers’ moods to achieve customer satisfaction. This\\nrequires prioritizing goals and assessing possible courses of\\naction and their outcomes with respect to the system’s goals.\\nBecause of flexibility and autonomy in decision-making[19],\\nAgentic AI can reconceptualize its strategies and adapt to new\\ninformation adopted in the model to operate in a changing\\nenvironment.\\nTo further illustrate the integration process of Agentic\\nAI into society, Figure 2 outlines the key stages. This\\nincludes data collection and preprocessing, the core Agentic\\nAI system’s functionality, and its deployment across various\\nindustries such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and\\ncustomer support. The flowchart visually represents the\\nadaptability and independence of Agentic AI in dynamic\\nenvironments.\\nD. COMPARATIVE ANAL YSIS\\nCompared to linear systems of regulation, Agentic AI stands\\nout because of its improved ability to remain autonomous,\\nfunction within an ever-changing context, and cope with\\nmultiple goals. In most cases, operative agents are created\\nwhere the functional area is characterized within rigid\\nboundaries, with unfailing and straightforward preconditions\\nfor successful performance. On the other hand, Agentic AI\\nsystems are designed to work on complex goals that have yet\\nto be structured and can be defined in a broad context.\\nAs shown in Table 3, traditional agents excel in structured\\ntasks but lack the flexibility required for adaptive, goal-\\noriented tasks in complex environments. Agentic AI advances\\nthese systems by introducing a high degree of autonomy\\nand adaptability, enabling the agent to interact with and\\nrespond to its environment in ways that extend beyond\\nsimple rule-following. This comparative analysis highlights\\nthe distinctive capabilities of Agentic AI, positioning it as a\\ntransformative approach in fields where independent, goal-\\ndriven, and context-aware behavior is essential.\\nIV. METHODOLOGIES IN AGENTIC AI DEVELOPMENT\\nA. ARCHITECTURAL APPROACHES\\nArchitectural approaches in Agentic AI typically involve\\nmodular and hierarchical designs that enable the system to\\nmanage complex goals and adapt to dynamic environments.\\nCommon architectures include multi-agent systems (MAS),\\nhierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), and goal-oriented\\nmodular architectures.\\n• Multi-Agent Systems (MAS): MAS [20] divides tasks\\namong multiple autonomous agents that collaborate or\\ncompete to achieve a common goal. This architecture is\\nparticularly useful in scenarios where complex goals can\\nbe decomposed into smaller tasks that individual agents\\ncan handle.\\n• Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL): HRL\\n[21] structures decision-making hierarchically, where\\nhigh-level agents define sub-goals, and low-level agents\\nexecute them. This approach is effective for managing\\ntasks with multiple levels of complexity.\\n• Goal-Oriented Modular Architectures: These archi-\\ntectures [22] organize agent functions into modular\\ncomponents, where each module specializes in specific\\naspects of the task. Such modularity enables flexibility\\nand scalability, allowing the agent to handle different\\ntasks by reconfiguring modules as needed.\\nB. LEARNING PARADIGMS\\nAgentic AI relies on several learning paradigms, each suited\\nto different types of tasks and goals. The main paradigms\\nused in agentic systems are supervised, unsupervised, and\\nreinforcement learning. Table 4 provides a comparison.\\nC. ADVANCEMENTS IN METHODOLOGIES\\nRecent advancements in Agentic AI methodologies have\\nfocused on key capabilities essential to modern agent design.\\nThese include reasoning and planning, tool use, memory\\nmechanisms, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and\\ninstruction fine-tuning [23].\\n1) REASONING AND PLANNING\\nThese frameworks enable agents to anticipate outcomes,\\nprioritize tasks, and adapt strategies dynamically. They\\nare critical for managing complex, multi-objective tasks\\nin evolving environments like disaster management and\\nautonomous navigation.\\n2) TOOL USE AND INTEGRATION\\nAgents equipped with the ability to interact with external\\ntools and APIs can perform computations, retrieve real-\\ntime data, and simulate scenarios, significantly enhancing\\ndecision-making processes.\\n3) MEMORY MECHANISMS\\nEpisodic and semantic memory models allow Agentic AI\\nsystems to retain contextual information, improving their\\nability to recall past interactions and optimize ongoing tasks.\\n4) RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)\\nRAG empowers agents to retrieve external knowledge\\ndynamically, enhancing the relevance and context of their\\noutputs. This capability is particularly significant in conver-\\nsational agents and real-time decision-making systems.\\n5) INSTRUCTION FINE-TUNING\\nThis process ensures that agents understand and execute\\nnuanced directives, enabling them to perform multi-step tasks\\nwith high precision and adaptability.\\nD. TRAINING AND EVALUATION TECHNIQUES\\nTraining Agentic AI systems requires techniques that allow\\nagents to learn from interactions with complex environments.\\nCommon training techniques include simulation-based train-\\ning, curriculum learning, and multi-task learning.\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18917'),\n",

This summary provides a concise reference\\nfor understanding the core techniques driving Agentic AI\\ndevelopment.\\nV. APPLICATIONS OF AGENTIC AI\\nA. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS\\nAgentic AI can potentially revolutionize multiple industries,\\nincluding healthcare, finance, education, and manufacturing.\\nIn healthcare, for example, Agentic AI can be used to\\nanalyze incoming patient data, identify abnormal patterns,\\nand alert corresponding medical personnel to damage. AI-\\nbased devices could, for example, prevent the delay of\\nvital diagnoses by monitoring patients’ key health indicators\\nand notifying them when the situation worsens. In finance,\\nfor instance, Agentic AI algorithms can assist in making\\ninvestment transactions, detecting fraudulent activities, and\\nproviding tailored investment solutions. They are capable\\nof evaluating the situation on the exchange, independently\\nmaking decisions regarding the purchase or sale of securities,\\nand adjusting their strategies to changing conditions in\\nreal time, which significantly improves the quality of\\nmanagerial performance and reduces the participation of\\nhuman beings [1].\\nIn education, intelligent tutoring systems utilizing Agen-\\ntic AI technology assist learners by tailoring educational\\ncontent [31] to their needs and addressing their progress\\nand requests. Such an approach leads to enhanced academic\\nperformance and decreased pressure on teachers because\\nrepetitive tasks such as grading and finding appropriate\\nmaterials are done automatically. In manufacturing, Agentic\\nAI is applied to predictive maintenance where the state of\\nthe machines is assessed, future breakdowns are anticipated\\nand maintenance is carried out when necessary without the\\ninvolvement of people so that production runs smoothly with\\nminimal delay. It is clear that once implemented, Agentic\\nAI enables industries to operate with greater effectiveness,\\nflexibility, and scalability.\\nB. HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION\\nAgentic AI extends the range of human productivity in\\ncollaborative and cognitive domains[32]. In such knowledge-\\nintensive ventures as legal or research, it can support pro-\\nfessionals by automatically condensing documents, pulling\\nup relevant papers, or performing professional background\\ninvestigations so the users can concentrate on more complex\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18919'),\n",

For example, in legal practice [33],\\nAgentic AI can examine a corpus of legal text, remember\\nessential documents and help lawyers retrieve cases with\\nsimilar laws.\\nIn the creative industries, Agentic AI can draft text, develop\\ndesign concepts, or make creative alterations based on earlier\\nedits or client input. Agentic AI tools are expected to be able\\nto reduce such needless tasks and improve the productivity of\\ncontent development. Also, in customer services, Agent AI\\ncan take care of simple questions, offer assistance, and route\\ncomplicated problems to human agents, enhancing response\\ntime and client satisfaction. This seamless integration of\\nhuman-AI collaboration enables workers to spend their\\ntime in a more strategic and creative workspace. At the\\nsame time, Agentic AI takes care of the operational\\naspects.\\nC. ADAPTIVE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\\nThere is a gradual move towards Agentic AI in adaptive\\nor ‘‘living’’ software systems [34], which can change their\\nfeatures without typical limitations and dynamically modify\\ntheir functionalities depending on environmental evolvement.\\nThese variables make the system reconfigure itself rapidly or\\nautomatically to ensure that self-learning improves every time\\naround usage. These include real-time updates of suggestions\\nby people as a function of the recommendations and updates\\nof suggestions based on changes in the evolution of the user\\nrecommendations dynamically.\\nOther cases include automated activities in the smart house\\nwhere, because of the powered agentic AI, boarders can\\nchange the lighting, temperatures and security protocols for\\ninbuilt AI to note the behavior of the users. In project\\ndevelopment processes, for instance, Agentic AI project\\nmanagement bots can focus on task sequencing, workload\\ndistribution, and task timeline complexity to dynamically\\nalter timelines [35] where necessary, which enables the users\\nto suit the various changes in the project quite effectively.\\nSuch adaptive software applications reduce human-in-the-\\nloop requirements and enhance the usability and functionality\\nof the system.\\nD. EMERGING APPLICATION AREAS\\nWith dynamic patient needs demanding continuous respon-\\nsiveness, there are new targeted use cases for applying\\nAgentic AI in specific spheres. Such include personalized\\nmedicine [36], where an Agentic AI system could manage\\nchronic patients by overseeing their patient history, sending\\nmedication intake reminders [37], and changing treatment\\nrecommendations based on other health indicators. Such\\nsystems would provide individualistic care-management\\nprotocol and even monitor for early indicators of other\\nprogressing health conditions, especially for aged people\\nlikely to require maximum attention.\\nFor literature creation, Agentic AI is expected to acquire\\nnew roles in generating content automatically, targeting\\nwider audiences and meeting precise parameters in content\\ncreation. For instance, in marketing, Agentic AI systems\\nwould send customized emails and adverts based on user\\nactivity and generate content for the adverts in the first\\nplace. Furthermore, in the context of self-regulatory research,\\nScientists using Agentic AI can accomplish the objectives of\\na literature search, developing new lines of thought, and even\\ncreating research designs.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF AGENTIC AI\\nIMPLEMENTATIONS\\nA. COMPARISON METRICS\\nTo comprehensively assess and triangulate Agentic AI\\ndeployments, it is necessary to identify metrics commensu-\\nrate with their output, flexibility and leverage. The following\\nmetrics are prevailing in the field:\\n• Adaptability: This metric considers the AI system’s\\npropensity or capability to react to environmental\\nmodifications that are prompt or abrupt actively. A high\\nadaptability [39] score means the AI system can undergo\\nperformance losses due to novel conditions like shifts\\nin statistical measures, but not to the extent of incurring\\nsignificant losses.\\n• Goal Achievement Efficiency: This metric reflects on\\nthe AI’s inclination or ability to achieve its goals while\\nusing minimal resources such as time and person-hours.\\nThis metric becomes critical in applications where the\\nprovision of the AI model’s determinism has strong\\nconsequences on the feasibility of the application.\\n• Learning Rate and Convergence: Measures the time\\nthe AI takes to learn and attach to a specific task. Quick\\nlearning rate and quick convergence are always preferred\\nas they enable the AI to work effectively in dynamic\\nenvironments requiring continual learning [40], [41].\\n• Robustness and Resilience: This measure determines\\nthe system’s performance level when its parameters\\nchange or during disturbances. Robustness [42], [43]is\\none attribute that enables the effective design of Agentic\\nAI, which can operate in several vitiating circumstances,\\nsuch as unexpected scenarios well deepened in the\\nhealthcare and autonomous driving sectors.\\n• Scalability: It refers to the system’s qualities, which\\nmust not change as the range or complexity of tasks\\nchanges. This is an important characteristic in indus-\\ntries with significant volumes of data or operational\\nprocesses, such as the case with finance or manufactur-\\ning [44].\\n• User Satisfaction and Human-AI Collaboration Effi-\\nciency: User satisfaction with Agentic AI systems\\ndependent on human interaction [45], [46] is a key\\nperformance indicator. This metric examines how lan-\\nguage, particularly AI’s involvement, translates into\\nproductivity, usability, and support quality for human\\ndoers.\\nTable 8 summarizes these metrics, providing a basis\\nfor evaluating Agentic AI implementations across various\\napplications.\\nB. CASE STUDIES\\nThe case studies presented in this subsection illustrate the\\npractical uses and performance of agentic AI systems in\\nseveral scenarios. These examples highlight the capabilities\\nof Agentic AI in accomplishing complex goals in a changing\\nenvironment.\\n• Healthcare Monitoring and Diagnostics: A healthcare\\nmonitoring system based on Agentic AI developed\\nfor healthcare monitoring can independently identify a\\npatient’s state to be deteriorating through steady tracking\\nof patients’ vital signs.

BENCHMARKING\\nBenchmarking is one of the most important procedures\\nfor assessing Agentic AI performance and its standard\\nmodel. This step is important as it allows model researchers\\nand developers to model. Some several standardized\\nbenchmarking datasets and environments have been devel-\\noped and are now used to carry out Agentic AI:\\n• Healthcare Datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, PhysioNet):\\nHealth care datasets [53], [54] are applied in the training\\nand evaluating systems for AI designs for patient\\nmonitoring, clinical diagnostic prediction, and clinical\\ndecision support. The claim that an Agentic AI system is\\ndoing an excellent job in Health care benchmarks shows\\nthat it is possible to make AI systems that can precisely\\nwork with such sensitive and life-critical information.\\n• Financial Data (e.g., Yahoo Finance, NASDAQ his-\\ntorical data): Fundamental datasets of respondents with\\nsales records [55] such as the historical stock prices are\\nvery useful for an Agentic AI, capable of predictive\\nanalytics and algorithmic trading. These datasets can\\nalso be used to rate the performance regarding prediction\\nability, robustness in fluctuating volatile markets, and\\nprofitability of trades.\\n• Autonomous Driving Simulators (e.g., CARLA, Ope-\\nnAI Gym): The environments allow for driving testing\\nfor autonomous navigation tasks and for AI in vehicles.\\nAI systems’ rate of learning, as well as their adaptive\\ncapability, are also tested under such environments [56],\\n[57]. Simulators are especially helpful in tests that\\ndemand systems to perform similar tasks of safety and\\ndecision-making under various conditions.\\n• Customer Service Datasets (e.g., MultiWOZ, Ama-\\nzon Customer Reviews): Efficient and personalized\\nAI-augmented customer interactions are evaluated in the\\ndimension of User and Systems or Support collaboration\\nwhere this set of data assists in the estimation of\\nsuch measures. The ability to perform well on these\\nbenchmarks is a direct indicator of the agent’s ability to\\nattend to user concerns as well as hold up to complex\\ninquiries.\\n• Manufacturing and IoT Datasets (e.g., NASA Prog-\\nnostics Data Repository): This data source consists of\\nsensor data from industrial equipment that is utilized to\\ntrain the AI application for predictive maintenance [58],\\n[59].

CRITICAL EVALUATION OF EXISTING\\nIMPLEMENTATIONS\\nExisting Agentic AI implementations highlight its trans-\\nformative potential and the challenges associated with its\\ndeployment.\\nSuccesses\\n• In healthcare, Agentic AI systems have successfully\\nmonitored patients, identified early warning signs,\\nand suggested interventions in real time.

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS\\nA. GOAL ALIGNMENT AND COMPLEXITY\\nA critical consideration in the design of any system is how the\\nautonomously set goals of the AI will agree with the diverse\\nperspectives of social morals and human users’ objectives.\\nIn more simplified terms, it is not like how AI generally\\noperates today, where there are set commands to follow.\\nIn contrast, agentic AI benefits from possessing a number\\nof highly complex goals, and these goals may evolve over\\ntime. There is a straightforward design problem here because\\npeople’s goals do not always lead to intended outcomes,\\nwhich could, for example, call for developing inappropriate\\ngoals, techniques, or strategies.\\nHowever, the question of goal misalignment is sometimes\\nmore easily addressed than when the central goals of the\\nprojects are multi-dimensional and contingent on the project\\ncontext. For example, in the case of medical ethics, an AI\\nagent operating for a maximum recovery rate of the patients\\nmight be focusing on those strategies that work fast and\\ngive results even in the short term but may not be the\\nbest thing in the long term. Furthermore, these issues are\\nintertwined with ethical goals and values structures, which\\nare difficult to articulate and integrate within the goal system\\ndue to cross-cultural or industry particularities. Addressing\\nthis problem is a requirement because other researchers are\\ninvestigating aligned frameworks like value alignment and\\ninverse reinforcement learning, wherein the etic systems are\\ncongruent with the emic reward systems. However, these\\nexplanations are still at the very basic understanding and\\nneed a lot of work to cope with complex changes in human\\ngoals.\\nB. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SITUATIONAL ADAPTABILITY\\nAs mentioned earlier, agentic AIs tend to be used in\\ndynamic and highly complex environments. This adaptability\\nchallenge relates to adapting to real-world conditions, which\\nmay change within a narrow time frame without human\\nintervention. In practical terms, it is quite challenging to\\nbe highly adaptive, as many dynamics in the real world\\nare highly unpredictable such as market trends in financial\\ninvestment, epidemiological trends in health care, or even\\njourney events in autonomous cars.\\nFor most agentic AI systems, technological or contextual\\nbarriers require action even when there is incomplete infor-\\nmation, increasing performance reliability ambiguities. For\\ninstance, in the case of autonomous driving, the agentic AI\\nmay not be familiar with the surrounding traffic conditions or\\nweather patterns such as snow or heavy rainfall, necessitating\\nthe need to adapt in a safe manner to maintain efficiency.\\nWhile meta-learning and reinforcement learning can help\\nincrease the adaptability of agents by allowing them to learn\\nfrom their past, the limitations lie within the approaches\\nas well, as adaptation and robustness are difficult goals\\nto achieve. Furthermore, implementing machine learning\\nmodels based on generalized processes in such complex\\nenvironments usually requires a high computing time, which\\nis only sometimes practical.\\nC. RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS\\nAgentic AIs are complex systems that require lots of\\ncomputation and energy resources for their training and\\ndeployment phases in navigable spaces. One is reinforcement\\nlearning, which greatly relies on simulation and data\\nprocessing and consequently increases the cost and time of\\n18924 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Milling out time for resource demands in\\nreal-time decision-making circumstances is a big challenge\\nin applications such as the finance industry and autonomous\\nvehicles.\\nIn addition, hardware is another resource for Agentic AI,\\nas these systems usually require specialized facilities when\\ndeployed in real-world environments. For instance, if an\\nautonomous drone or robot is to be used, it would require\\nhigh-performing GPUs, low-latency sensors, and a vital\\nenergy source to enable prompt decision-making. In addition,\\nthe proliferation of agentic systems, especially those based\\non centralized control and monitoring, can put an increasing\\nstrain on data storage, processing and network bandwidth\\nresources. Coupled with these challenges are the hardware\\noptimization methods and energy-efficient algorithms that\\nwill be required to implement Agentic AI systems largely and\\ncost-effectively efficiently.\\nD. SCALABILITY\\nWith the complexity of design increasing, scaling improves\\nthe system’s performance. Some applications of Agent AI,\\nwhether in smart cities, healthcare, or financial services,\\nare massive in scale, requiring a higher AI-to-agent ratio,\\nmultifaceted tasks, or huge amounts of data to be handled.\\nHowever, it is nontrivial to ensure that such systems can\\nbe scaled up to a higher level without losing some key\\nperformance metrics, as it usually involves a multitude of\\nconcurrent tasks and data sources.\\nMultiple agents or components design and their interaction\\npresents a major challenge regarding scalability. For example,\\nin a smart city, there may be an AI that manages traffic,\\nenergy, and waste collection. Different architectures must\\nbe capable of getting required subsystems to work together\\nand perform complex tasks simultaneously. Besides, as most\\narchitects understand, the scaling of Agent AI also magnifies\\nproblems like goal dependency, resource usage, and the\\nability to act in plenty of scenarios. Today, decentralized\\ncontrol, federated learning, and hierarchical structures are\\nbeing used or researched to improve scalability. However,\\nthe problem remains as scaling out seamless techniques is\\na technological limitation related to AI operating at a larger\\nscale.\\nTable 10 provides a summary of the primary technical\\nchallenges and limitations faced in the development and\\ndeployment of Agentic AI. Addressing these challenges is\\nessential to advancing the field and ensuring that Agentic\\nAI systems can function effectively and responsibly in real-\\nworld scenarios.\\nVIII. ETHICAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE\\nIMPLICATIONS\\nA. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY\\nIn light of the decision-making independence such systems\\ndisplay, understanding accountability and responsibility in\\nAgentic AI systems is a complex challenge. With the more\\ntraditional AI systems, tools fall under the purview of people\\n– the developer, the operator, or the user and the responsibility\\nrests with the person who uses the tool. With Agentic AI,\\nthe question of accountability is more contentious due to\\nthe nature of an independent-acting AI. In situations where\\nautonomous AI makes a decision that results in a negative\\noutcome, the question of responsibility is often misplaced;\\nis it the developer, the service provider who deploys the AI,\\nor the AI system.\\nThis particular issue comes out clearly in areas such as\\nfinance and healthcare, where such systems deal with high-\\nstakes decision-making with high repercussions. There needs\\nto be a more significant gap between the responsibility and\\nliability attribution frameworks and the behavioral intricacies\\npresent in Agentic AI systems. Therefore, Regulations and\\npossibly new legal structures must be invoked to delineate\\nresponsibility or accountability, especially in environments\\nwhere multiple stakeholders are participating in the execution\\nof the system, which is most of the time.\\nB. BIAS, FAIRNESS, AND TRANSPARENCY\\nIt is also known that agentic AI systems may replicate and\\nexacerbate biases in the training data available to them. The\\nnotion of bias is especially concerning regarding the use of\\nAgentic AI in hiring, policing, and lending practices. Not\\nonly must these biases be acknowledged, but they must also\\nbe addressed through appropriate data management, careful\\nalgorithm deployment, and active bias reduction programs.\\nStill, it is essential to note that addressing bias and mitigating\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18925'),\n",

Technical challenges and limitations in agentic AI.\\nit in autonomous systems is a much more difficult task than\\nin traditional AI because of the nature of the tasking such\\nsystems are designed to perform.\\nAnother important aspect that also helps enhance fairness\\nand trust in Agentic AI [60] systems is transparency.\\nThese systems’ operations must be explained through\\nXAI approaches, and there must be an effort to make\\ntransparent decision-making processes for end users and\\nrelevant stakeholders. This exposure can help effectively\\ncheck an AI’s actions and create a framework for tackling\\nbias or injustice. However, explainability is quite challenging\\nto attain fundamentally, and a more significant deal of\\nit is supposed to be achieved in cases of agentic AI\\nsystems, which tend to use deep reinforcement learning\\nmodels. This area of concern has always been find-\\ning the right balance between structural complexity and\\ntransparency.\\nC. PRIVACY AND SECURITY ISSUES\\nThe agents can perform their functions effectively in different\\nenvironments by relying on relevant information, often\\nprivate in domains like healthcare and finance, that are\\nalready sensitive areas. Such reliance on personal information\\ninvites privacy concerns as data can be mishandled and even\\naccessed illegally, leading to a large breach of user privacy.\\nAdditionally, in this context, the autonomous ability of the\\nAgentic AI can pose a challenge as the data usage can be\\ndifficult to track, thus increasing the likelihood of privacy\\nabuse.\\nThere is also a security challenge in that cyber-attacks can\\nthreaten these systems, undermining their intended purpose\\nand exposing weaknesses in the system in place. If agentic AI\\nsystems are hacked, they could bring forth a lot of destruction,\\nprimarily when the systems govern critical infrastructure or\\nsensitive tasks that need to be decided within that context.\\nThere is a great need to maintain a robust and holistic\\napproach towards cybersecurity, as it is required to secure\\nthe information that such systems depend on and their\\nfunctionality. While techniques such as differential privacy\\nand secure multi-party computation may seem promising,\\nprivacy and security threats still exist, so implementation\\nshould be done carefully to retain the required functional\\nprivacy.\\nD. REGULATORY AND LEGAL PERSPECTIVES\\nThe regulatory and legal perspective on Agentic AI is\\nstill a work in progress as regulators try to streamline\\nthe unique challenges that autonomous systems present.\\nThe AI regulations as they stand today mainly address\\nprivacy, transparency, and accountability issues but may\\nnot necessarily tackle the challenges posed by Agentic\\nAI’s autonomy. For instance, the like of the EU’s General\\nData Protection Regulation (GDPR) [61] imposes stringent\\nobligations with respect to data and user consent, but these\\nrequirements may not be adequate when managing AI\\nsystems that operate in real-time with autonomous decisions.\\nPolicymakers [62] are also investigating other frameworks,\\nparticularly for high-risk AI systems. Some approaches\\ncall for an ‘‘AI responsibility chain,’’ which can help\\nstakeholders determine the accountability of each party of\\nthe AI systems. In contrast, others recommend a mandatory\\nexplainability for some AI applications. Legal standards for\\nAgentic AI are likely to include risk management plans\\nthat contain requirements for conducting risk assessments,\\nperiodic audits, and certifications for systems operating in\\nsusceptible sectors such as health, finance, and security. It is,\\nhowever, expected that as Agentic AI progresses, developing\\nlegal frameworks that enable innovation while enhancing\\nsafety and accountability will be crucial.\\nTable 11 summarizes the primary ethical and governance\\nconsiderations for Agentic AI, highlighting the complexities\\nthat arise as these systems become increasingly autonomous.\\nIX. CURRENT FRAMEWORKS FOR SAFE AND\\nACCOUNTABLE AGENTIC AI\\nA. SAFETY PROTOCOLS\\nSeveral safety measures and frameworks have been created\\nas a requirement to prevent the autonomous risks involved\\nwith decision-making. One of the most basic methods is\\ngoal safety protocols, being objective-oriented procedures\\nto suggest to the AI which goals are acceptable to pursue\\nand which actions are harmful. These protocols prevent\\nharm by ensuring that AI endeavors to achieve legal, safe,\\nand ethical goals. Also, to prevent AI from going out of\\nbounds or reaching unanticipated dangerous situations, fail-\\nsafe mechanisms [63] are deployed, which can adjust or even\\nterminate AI activities altogether.\\n18926 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nTABLE 11. Ethical and governance considerations for agentic AI.\\nOne such framework primarily employed is the risk\\nevaluation and management protocol [64], which leads\\nto the review of the risks posed by the actions of the AI,\\nand subsequently, the control measures are put in place.\\nThis is especially important in healthcare and autonomous\\ndriving scenarios, where AI takes actions that impact human\\nlives. Additionally, some Agentic AI systems utilize ethical\\nguardrails [65], which restrain the AI from making decisions\\nthat raise ethical concerns and promote the AI to perform\\naccording to social norms and ethics. The illustrated safety\\nprotocols work as a system of layers, offering a good level of\\nprotection for the abuse of Agentic AI in an ethical manner.\\nB. MONITORING AND CONTROL MECHANISMS\\nThe autonomous action of agentic AI systems requires\\nmonitoring and control mechanisms to govern such actions\\nand allow for human intervention where necessary.Real-time\\nmonitoring systems [66], [67] oversee the AI’s activities and\\ndecisions and allow humans to intervene if necessary. For\\nexample, in the case of financial trading systems, AI can\\nbe employed to identify unusual trade patterns in real-time\\ntrading by alerting the relevant authorities and allowing for\\nthe conduct of such activities to be at acceptable risk levels.\\nSuch frameworks as Human-in-the-loop (HITL) [68]\\nand human-on-the-loop (HOTL) [69] have been designed\\nwith the idea of maintaining an equilibrium between the\\nextent of autonomy experienced and the necessity of human\\ncontrol. When HITL configurations are deployed, human\\noperators tend to approve some actions and directly interact\\nwith the AI while making certain decisions. On the other\\nhand, in HOTL systems, the human supervisor monitors the\\nAI without deciding on every action but can intervene when\\nnecessary. These mechanisms are essential for healthcare and\\nother serious decisions involving AI, where the presence of\\nhuman intelligence is still required.\\nOverride protocols also exist in Agentic AI systems to\\nstop or change actions undertaken by the AI if a situation is\\nclassified as unforeseen or falls outside the reasonable range\\nof expected behavior. Last-line systems provide another\\nlevel of defense by making it possible for the AI to\\nbe overpowered by a human if its autonomous conduct\\nbecomes damaging. Combined with the aforementioned,\\nthese monitoring and control measures are designed to\\ndeliver a multitude of defense in depth to ensure that the\\nagentic artificial intelligence does not exceed controlled and\\nsupervised settings, with all sorts of human intervention\\nprocedures firmly in place.\\nC. TRANSPARENCY MECHANISMS\\nTrust and accountability are foundational to the deployment\\nof Agentic AI, and both can be eroded owing to lack of\\ntransparency. Explainable AI (XAI) [70], [71] techniques\\nhave been proposed to offer a more transparent view of\\nthe inner workings of these multi-layered decision-making\\nAI models. As a result, XAI enriches the accountability of\\nthe processes involved in reaching decisions as leaders in a\\nparticular field, such as that of finance and healthcare, where\\ndecisions have profound consequences, are informed about\\nthe premises on which specific actions were taken.\\nBeyond just the transparent nature, audit trails can also\\nbe added as an extra layer within Agentic AI systems\\nto document every logic and decision so that the actions\\ntaken by the AI can be examined afterward. These logs are\\nperfect for compliance because they can assist organizations\\nin ensuring that past choices were compliant with the\\nlaw. Self-documenting algorithms [72] also help promote\\nself-explainable AI by automatically preparing reports and\\nexplanations about the system’s decisions while it is in\\noperation. Such mechanisms not only foster transparency\\nbut also facilitate feedback mechanisms, as they enable\\ndevelopers and stakeholders to improve and understand the\\ndecision-making process of the AI over time.\\nD. CASE STUDIES OF GOVERNANCE APPROACHES\\nSeveral industry and academic efforts have created gover-\\nnance frameworks to guarantee the safe, responsible and\\nethical use of AI. Here are several examples that are worth\\nmentioning [73]:\\n• Microsoft’s AI Principles and Responsible AI Stan-\\ndard: These include fairness, reliability, privacy, inclu-\\nsiveness, and transparency, which govern the shaping\\nof AI systems according to Microsoft’s Responsible AI\\nStandard. It also contains the Aether Committee, which\\nfairly addresses the ethical and social issues brought\\nabout by AI. There have been other products throughout\\nthe business for which this framework has been used to\\nbuild robust AI risk processes throughout Microsoft’s\\nofferings.\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18927'),\n",

OPEN RESEARCH CHALLENGES AND FUTURE\\nDIRECTIONS\\nThe development and deployment of Agentic AI systems\\npresent several open research challenges that require attention\\nto ensure safe, effective, and ethically aligned AI. This\\nsection explores these challenges and outlines potential future\\ndirections for advancing Agentic AI.\\nA. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nIn dynamic and uncertain contexts, Agentic AI systems must\\ndemonstrate adaptability and resilience as they operate in the\\nenvironment. Most existing models do not generalize across\\nthe environments or change significantly without retraining.\\nThus, future work might involve solving meta-learning\\nand transfer-learning problems specifically for Agentic AI\\nsystems, allowing them to rapidly adapt to new situations\\nbased on their previous experiences. Moreover, it would be\\ninteresting to research on platforms that enable real-time\\nlearning whereby agents learn and modify in response to\\nchanges but their primary functions are not affected. This\\nwould improve both resilience and adaptability tremendously.\\nB. IMPROVING GOAL ALIGNMENT WITH HUMAN VALUES\\nIntegrating ethical and value-based human approaches into\\nAgentic AI systems is one of the open branches of research\\nthat should be advanced in the future. Given the autonomous\\nnature of operating these systems, there exists the possibility\\nof a goal misalignment problem whereby the AI is driven\\nto do the right thing. Still, the action is contrary to human\\ninterests. This work can explore value alignment strategies\\nsuch as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and cooperative\\ninverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), in which the AI goes\\nthrough experience and exposure to human social context\\nto learn human preferences and values. In addition, such\\nframeworks should be created that would permit real-time\\nadjustments to the level of alignment between Agentic AI and\\nhuman objectives depending on changing social behavior or\\nthe targeted audience’s cues.\\nC. INTEGRATION INTO LIVING SOFTWARE AND\\nCYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS\\nWhen Agentic AI is widespread, developing robust ethical\\nand global guidelines for this technology application and\\ndevelopment will be essential. Autonomous decision-making\\nin the systems complicates ethical issues like bias, privacy,\\naccountability, and transparency. Areas of future research\\ncan be directed at how to build a universal ethical frame-\\nwork for Agentic AI, which may include mechanisms of\\nmultidimensional ethical audit, oversight, and certification.\\nThis includes initiatives involving policymakers, ethicists,\\nand AI practitioners to embed supervisory mechanisms that\\nfoster advancements without undermining other societal\\ninterests [75].\\nD.

Each area\\nhighlights critical aspects of advancing the field responsibly\\nand sustainably.\\nF. SCALABILITY AND EFFICIENCY\\nThe deployment of Agentic AI systems in large-scale and\\ncomplex environments imposes new constraints, resulting in\\nvast requirements for scalability and efficiency. There are\\nscenarios when such systems need to manage resources and\\ninformation at large, interact with numerous agents, and make\\ndecisions within a short period. For both scalability and\\nefficiency to be achieved, new advancements in algorithms,\\narchitectures, and hardware have to be made. This research\\narea is characterized by the use of centerless and hierarchical\\nframeworks and distributed processing or energy-efficient\\nhardware.\\nAside from its numerous advantages, a well-known\\nlimitation that stems from the emergence of decentralized\\narchitectures is their integration into large-scale systems.\\nSince the control process can be handled by numerous nodes\\nin a fully distributed way, there is no need for a single\\ncentralized controller. Thus, the responsibility and load of this\\nnode do not affect the system’s scalability. An improvement\\nof specific processes in this-style architecture might include\\ncertain structural, behavioral rules that regularize agents’\\nactions regarding network interactions. The more structures\\ndecorated with efficient elements of decentralized control,\\nthe quicker the optimized directional tasks and networks as\\na whole system will be, where optimization processes occur\\nin bulks of intelligent agents. As it has become apparent in\\nrecent years, these tasks have become possible with systems\\nbased on swarm intelligence and decentralized [79] control\\nof structures and processes.\\nAnother area of interest is the hierarchical models,\\nwhich break down decision-making processes into different\\nlayers [80], where the system can only focus on general goals\\nand distribute particular actions to subordinate agents. For\\ninstance, in the smart city context, a hierarchical Agentic\\nAI could oversee the movement of cars throughout the\\ncity. At the same time, local agents manage the traffic\\nat a particular intersection. This configuration diminishes\\nthe computation each agent has to perform and enables\\nbetter system scalability. The hierarchical models have found\\nmuch application in the coordinated control of multiple,\\ninterdependent processes in a system since they allow for\\nagnostic task scheduling as the state of the system changes.\\nBalanced loading of tasks among processors is another\\nfactor that improves scalability since it allows distribut-\\ning computations over several devices or servers. Within\\ndistributed processing frameworks, large scale Agentic AI\\nsystems could make the most of cloud or edge computing\\nresources to carry out computation in multiple processes and\\nlower the time taken to respond. Such a situation proves\\nhelpful in operating in remote applications or in time-critical\\nsituations such as autonomous vehicles or smart grid sys-\\ntems where real-time data processing and decision-making\\nare critical. There is ongoing advancement in deploying\\ndistributed AI frameworks, such as federated learning [81]\\nand edge AI [82], that enhance the maneuverability of\\nAgentic AI systems in a wider operational area with dispersed\\ninstallations [83].\\nApart from the AI systems integration, improvement of the\\nAgentic AI systems embodies energy-efficient algorithms\\nand hardware optimizations [84]. This is vital when\\nthe applications must run endlessly and provide real-time\\nresponses. Several Agentic AI models are built using opera-\\ntionally expensive algorithms like deep reinforcement learn-\\ning, requiring enormous power resources. Further progress\\nis made in energy-efficient machine learning approaches,\\nsuch as sparse neural networks and quantized models that\\naddress the computation requirements at lower levels while\\nretaining the quality of the end products. Furthermore,\\nneuromorphic processors and AI accelerators are some of the\\nemerging hardware technologies that are meant to enable the\\nperformance of AI tasks with minimal power requirements.\\nThese hardware improvements are critical in expanding the\\nAgentic AI systems to edge devices and IoT applications with\\nlimited or no power resources.\\nAlthough progress has been achieved, they only partially\\nsolve the problem of scalability and efficiency, which con-\\ntinue to be active research issues as real-world environments\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18929'),\n",

Summary of open research challenges and future directions in agentic AI.\\nbecome increasingly complex. Future directions in this area\\ninclude the development of adaptive resource allocation\\ntechniques [85] that dynamically allocate computational\\nresources based on task importance, as well as self-\\noptimizing algorithms [86] that adjust their complexity\\ndynamically depending on the requirements. Moreover,\\nthanks to collaborative intelligence [87] conception, agents\\nwill be able to solve issues without complicated integration\\nprocesses as they will be able to handle sophisticated\\noperations collectively, thus enhancing system scalability.\\nG. ENHANCED ADAPTABILITY AND RESILIENCE\\nAgentic AI systems, particularly those employed by a human\\nworker or soldier, are built to endure persistence under\\ndemanding, unpredictable conditions. Therefore, achieving\\npersistent operational success would require these systems to\\nmodify their actions autonomously and gain further learning\\nresilience constantly. How can one reach such a high level\\nof learning resilience? One possible answer lies in the use of\\nAgentic AI technologies that can generalize across different\\nenvironments and concepts, deal with high uncertainty, and\\ncope with unforeseen interruptions.\\nOne exciting way of achieving such resilience is through\\nmeta-learning, or what children call ‘‘learning to learn.’’\\nSuch meta-learning algorithms enable an AI to learn informa-\\ntion that may apply to different assignments or environments,\\nallowing the AI to be flexible with virtually no retraining.\\nFor example, in robotic tasks [88], a meta-learning agent\\nraised in one environment (let’s say, in the house) can move\\nto an alternative environment (the outside) and assume the\\nknowledge of moving within the outside environment. This\\nis because AI can now learn like humans [89] and use\\nits past experiences in the environment to approach new\\nsituations [90].\\nAnother significant approach for enhancing adaptability is\\ncalled transfer learning [91]. It has proved that unlike static\\nmodels trained for a particular purpose, a learning model\\ntrained for one task can perform a similar or even related,\\nyet distinct, task. This method is particularly convenient for\\nAgentic AIs acting in many different operational spheres,\\nenabling the system to leverage its previous lessons instead of\\nacquiring new ones. Transfer learning is known to be effective\\nduring these scenarios since it allows the AI to adjust to\\ndifferent patient profiles or drive in different environments,\\nsuch as autonomous driving.\\nResilience in the case of Agentic AI systems is crucial\\nas it allows them to deliver consistent outcomes despite\\nupsets being caused by compromised sensors, intermittent\\nnetworks or external factors that were not anticipated.\\nTo increase resilience, there are ongoing investigations on\\nrobust reinforcement learning techniques that enable the\\nreliable functioning of agents in the presence of consistent\\nuncertainty or unknown noise. Robust reinforcement learning\\nmethods rely on dual dynamics, allowing the learner to\\nseek performance maximization and impact minimization\\nof stochastic events. This dual objective ensures the agent\\ncan effectively implement its functionalities even when the\\nnormal conditions vary.\\nSelf-recovery mechanisms are being explored as sup-\\nplementary to everyday learning strategies. Self-recovery\\nmechanisms allow Agentic AI systems to auto-flag and\\nrectify their duplicates without help. For example, self-\\nrecovery strategies in autonomous robotics may include\\nobstacle avoidance strategies where the robot uses an\\nalternative approach or site configuration strategies. System\\nself-recovery mechanisms allow seamless system restoration\\nafter a range of disruptions, which is particularly beneficial\\nto mission-critical areas like disaster management and space\\nexploration, where human intervention is not always feasible.\\nThe stand-out areas of research that are helpful in both the\\nmodification and robustness of Agentic AI include real-time\\nlearning. AI self-recovery mechanisms [92], on the other\\nhand, include real-time learning. This mechanism allows\\nAI systems to receive and integrate new information into\\nrelevant models without ceasing operational activities. This is\\nexcellent, for example, in the finance or cyber warfare zones\\nmodels, which require swift AI alterations on market changes\\nor threats. However, with this capability, new challenges also\\narise related to the real-time processing of data, the ability to\\nconduct computation, model maintenance, and stability, and\\nthese need to be addressed in future studies.\\n18930 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

B. Acharya et al.: Agentic AI: Autonomous Intelligence for Complex Goals—A Comprehensive Survey\\nLooking to the future, progress in improving adaptability\\nand survivability will likely include the creation of context-\\naware learning algorithms [93], which evaluate the setting\\nand act by it. In other words, some form of contextual\\nAI could switch its unitary decision-making style depend-\\ning on uncertainty or resource availability. Furthermore,\\ninvestigation of multi-modal learning [94], [95], which\\nfuses information from multiple sources and types to better\\nunderstand different situations, may assist in improving the\\nversatility of Agentic AI systems in the operative context.\\nWith visual, auditory, and other kinds of information, multi-\\nmodal learning can be particularly effective for autonomous\\nvehicles trying to function in complex situations.\\nH. ETHICAL FRAMEWORKS AND GLOBAL STANDARDS\\nThe increasing capabilities of Autonomous Agentic AI\\nsystems operating in significant sectors have intensified\\nthe call for appropriate ethical considerations and global\\nstandards to be put in place. These considerations and\\nstandards are pivotal in regulating how Agentic AI interacts\\nwith stakeholders and the environment to minimize adverse\\nimpacts, biases, and threats to safety and privacy. In addition,\\nappropriate and well-thought-out ethical considerations and\\nglobal standards also seek to define the scope and areas of\\ntransparency, equity, accountability, and user privacy, which\\nneed to be emphasized in the design and use of AI.\\nOne of the critical barriers to establishing these frame-\\nworks is the existence of ethical and legal variety in\\ndifferent societies. Ethical issues, including data protection,\\ntransparency in who took the decision, and reliance on\\nautonomous decisions, may range from one society to another\\ndepending on legal order, customs, traditions, or politics.\\nFor these differences to be addressed while promoting\\nsynergies among regions, a global set of ethical standards\\nfor AI governance is fundamental. Establishing universal\\nethical principles can provide the basis for this alignment by\\ndeveloping common approaches to equity, non-maleficence\\nand beneficence that would override local differences.\\nTransparency and Explainability are undoubtedly the\\ncomponents of an ethical algorithm since they allow third\\nparties to comprehend the decision-making process of artifi-\\ncial intelligence. In Agentic AI, such attributes are necessary\\nfor users’ trust, especially in crucial sectors like healthcare\\nand finance, where the rationale behind the decision needs\\nto be accountable. These include XAI techniques that\\nallow stakeholders to explain the interpretation process.\\nTherefore, given the erosion of these fundamental rights,\\nthese frameworks should emphasize the need to incorporate\\nstakeholders’ responsibilities and authorities’ mechanisms to\\nscrutinize AI-generated decisions [96].\\nMore important and unwaveringly related to the develop-\\nment of ethical frameworks is the issue of an Accountability\\nand Responsibility. With the growing autonomy of agents in\\nsociety, there have been significant difficulties in determining\\nwho should be held responsible for the results of AI-enhanced\\nacts. Provisions for processes that would enable tracing\\nresponsibility in a wide range of stakeholders, including\\nfarmers, custodians, and machines, must be in place. Some\\napproaches suggest an AI responsibility chain, which\\nseparates the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder\\nduring the development and deployment process to prevent\\nover-reliance on one individual [97].\\nPrivacy and Security Standards are especially critical\\nwhen addressing Agentic AI, which generally requires\\noperating on susceptible data. There should be guidelines\\nprescribing how data is managed, secured or anonymized\\nto meet user privacy. This includes baseline restrictions on\\nprocessing, such as the use of differential privacy and secure\\naccess to databases, which allow for reducing possibilities\\nfor breaches or abuse of the data. Furthermore, appropriate\\nmeasures should be employed to safeguard the security\\nof Agentic AI, especially in smart cities and autonomous\\nvehicles where such AI systems are exposed to potential\\ncyber threats and can be a danger to the public.\\nTo concretize these principles, several regulating author-\\nities and industry associations have suggested using ethical\\nguidelines and frameworks aimed at the responsible use of\\nartificial intelligence. In particular, some of the core material\\nfor the legal issues of privacy and other user rights are con-\\ntained in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI developed\\nby the European Union and the General Data Protection\\nRegulation. Similarly, the IEEE and the Partnership on AI\\norganizations have also formulated some behavioral artificial\\nintelligence ethics addressing responsibility, fairness, and\\nopenness issues. Although these guidelines have no universal\\napplication, effective international government authority has\\nbeen advocated to coordinate the interaction between AI\\npolicies and standards from different countries.\\nA further development concerning the issue is establishing\\nan internationally operating AI coordinating entity or a\\nconsortium like in Europe that could promote the estab-\\nlishment of AI standards and global adherence to ethical\\nprinciples. This organization would create an objective to\\nstandardize AI regulations so that ethical norms and safety\\nrequirements will invariably be provided across countries and\\nindustries. Moreover, it necessitates research on adaptive\\nregulatory regimes [98] that are responsive to technological\\ndevelopments.\\nTable 14 summarizes the primary components of ethical\\nframeworks and global standards for Agentic AI, outlining\\nessential areas for responsible and safe AI governance.\\nI.

In a larger perspective, however,\\nsome theoretical extensions of the issues, like multi-agent\\ncoordination, meta-goal achievement, active persistence, and\\nplanner controlling with ethical consideration, assist the AI\\nmodels in behaving appropriately in different environments.\\nMulti-agent coordination is an example of such a class\\nof theories, and it is concerned with allowing AI agents\\nto engage, communicate, and collaborate in environments\\nthat contain multiple autonomous entities.

Developments in this domain will\\nallow Agentic AI to carry out interdependent complex tasks\\nwhere agents must cooperate and compete.\\nLong-term goal management is decisive and is char-\\nacterized as having advanced agentic capabilities. There\\nare deeply ingrained limitations concerning timelines with\\ncurrent AI systems.

We also identified open research challenges, including\\ngoal alignment, multi-agent coordination, and regulatory\\nadaptation, which must be addressed to fully realize the\\npotential of Agentic AI.\\nB. FINAL INSIGHTS ON AGENTIC AI\\nAgentic AI holds transformative potential across numerous\\nsectors, promising advances in automation, decision-making,\\nand human-AI collaboration. As these systems evolve,\\nthey are poised to tackle complex tasks autonomously,\\nsignificantly expanding the scope of AI applications in both\\nstructured and unstructured environments. By combining\\nadaptive learning, robust reinforcement mechanisms, and\\nreal-time responsiveness, Agentic AI systems can deliver\\ndynamic solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency.\\nHowever, with increased autonomy comes the responsibility\\nto address ethical considerations and ensure accountability,\\ntransparency, and fairness. As Agentic AI continues to\\nevolve, it is essential that these systems are developed with\\na clear focus on ethical alignment, resilience, and regula-\\ntory compliance to prevent potential misuse or unintended\\nconsequences.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] A.

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nAI encompasses capabilities such as learning, reasoning,\\nand self-correction, enabling machines to perform tasks that\\ntypically require human intelligence. Today, AI is crucial\\nfor legal tech firms, enhancing operations to serve clients\\nmore affordably and accurately. Key AI applications include\\ncontract review, legal research, and predictive analytics for\\ncase outcomes and court rulings. Additionally, chatbots are\\nbecoming increasingly popular for providing self-service\\nlegal information. Political institutions and governments\\nare actively supporting AI development. For instance, a\\n2020 report [2] highlighted AI’s role in improving agency\\noperations like regulatory enforcement and data analysis in\\nthe U.S. The European Union also emphasizes excellence and\\ntrust in AI, aiming to enhance research and industrial capacity\\nwhile protecting fundamental rights [3].\\nThe integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and\\nAI into legal tasks is a natural progression, given the linguistic\\nnature of law. This combination allows for more efficient and\\naccurate analysis of legal texts, enhancing various aspects of\\nlegal practice. The use of NLP and AI in legal tech has a long\\nhistory, dating back to the 1960s with the development of\\nonline legal content search systems [4], [5], [6]. NLP , particu-\\nlarly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), has\\nmade significant strides in legal applications, aiding in tasks\\nrequiring language processing and understanding. LLMs\\nrepresent cutting-edge technology, advancing AI approaches\\nin various domains involving textual contents such as\\nmedicine [7], [8], [9], engineering [10], [11] and law [12],\\n[13], [14], [15]. Overall, the integration of AI and NLP in the\\nlegal domain holds great promise for improving efficiency\\nand decision-making processes across various legal tasks.\\nHowever, addressing challenges related to context, data\\navailability, and interpretability remains essential for the\\nreliable application of these technologies in the legal domain\\n[16], [17]. Within this context, applications refer to the\\nbroader use cases where AI technologies address specific\\nlegal challenges or fulfil specific needs, such as contract\\nreview, document automation, and compliance monitoring.\\nThese applications are representations of particular instances\\nof how models, algorithms, or tools are applied to legal tasks.\\nConversely, tasks within legal AI are the specific activities\\nthat AI systems perform within these applications, such\\nas identifying key clauses in contracts, extracting relevant\\ninformation, or generating summaries.\\nThis article aims to comprehensively examine the appli-\\ncations of LLMs in the legal domain, focusing on how\\nvarious models and techniques are used in legal tasks. Based\\non recent literature [3], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22],\\n[23], [24], [25], we have grouped the tasks into three main\\nareas: Legal Search, Legal Document Review and Legal\\nPrediction. To identify the current state of the applications of\\nTransformers in the legal domain, we analysed the existing\\nliterature from 2017 to 2023. The year 2017 was chosen as\\nthe starting point because it marks the introduction of the\\nTransformer architecture [26]. A timeline of the evolution\\nduring these years is depicted in the Figure 1. We conducted\\na database search and snowballing method, resulting in\\nan initial pool of publications. After a rigorous quality\\nassessment and filtering process, we selected 61 publications\\nthat met our criteria for relevance and methodological\\nrigour. By identifying and analysing specific instances where\\nLLM-based methodologies are applied, we highlight their\\neffectiveness and limitations in addressing various legal chal-\\nlenges. Our goal is to offer a thorough understanding of how\\nthese technologies can aid domain experts, such as law firms,\\njudges, and lawyers, and facilitate automated resolution and\\ndocument generation processes within the legal domain.\\nThis endeavour involves defining and extracting legal tasks\\nand identifying trends and uses of LLMs in the legal\\ndomain.\\nThe rest of the article is structured as follows: Section II\\npresents the background and related work, and Section III\\ndescribes the research method. Section IV reports a bib-\\nliometric analysis of the literature reviewed, Section V\\nprovides the overview of the models and approaches, whereas\\nSection VI the trends within legal tasks and real-life\\nimplementations. Section VII states the conclusions, and\\nSection VIII discusses the implications of our findings for\\nfuture research.\\nII. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\\nIn this section, the landscape of legal AI is thoroughly\\nexamined in various studies, highlighting its diverse appli-\\ncations and advancements. The application of AI in the\\nlegal sector has long garnered significant interest, focusing\\non its implications for legal practice, administration, and\\nthe ethical considerations surrounding its use with legal\\ndata. Early explorations into online legal content search\\nsystems date back to the 1960s [5], [27], highlighting the\\nlongstanding intersection of AI and law. Zhong et al. [28]\\nclassify legal AI tasks into three categories: judgement\\nprediction, similar case matching, and legal question answer-\\ning, with early Transformer-based language models being\\nnotable contributors. Sansone and Sperlí [29] categorize\\nlegal information retrieval approaches into natural language-\\nbased, ontology-based, and deep learning-based systems.\\nAdditionally, Katz et al. [30] provide an extensive review\\nof NLP in the legal domain, documenting the growth in\\nresearch publications and tasks over the past decade. Dale\\net al. [31] focus on NLP applications in contract review and\\ndocument automation, emphasizing their importance for legal\\npractitioners.\\nThe advent of Transformer models (from now on also\\nLLMs) [26] marked a defining moment as well the LLMs,\\nrevolutionizing the landscape of deep-learning architectures\\nand setting new benchmarks for performance across a\\nspectrum of intricate NLP tasks. Central to the Transformer’s\\ninnovation is its integration of attention mechanisms [32],\\nwhich diverge from conventional Recurrent Neural Net-\\nworks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).\\nBy harnessing attention mechanisms, the Transformer\\narchitecture orchestrates a holistic consideration of an\\n18254 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Attention is\\nmanifested in two distinct modalities within the Transformer\\nframework. Initially, attention gauges the relative signifi-\\ncance of words within the same sequence, treating input\\nwords as both origins and destinations. This self-attention\\nmechanism endeavours to compute optimal representations\\nof the input sequence, encapsulating syntactic and semantic\\nrelationships. Subsequently, input representations undergo\\nweighted attention to predict target tokens in an autoregres-\\nsive fashion.\\nLLMs such as ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential\\nin various legal tasks, particularly in legal judgement\\nprediction and statutory reasoning [33]. Trautmann et al.\\n[34] introduce legal prompt engineering to enhance LLM\\nperformance in judgement prediction tasks, demonstrat-\\ning effectiveness across multilingual datasets. Blair-Stanek\\net al. [35] explore GPT-3’s aptitude for statutory rea-\\nsoning, achieving high accuracy with dynamic few-shot\\nprompting. Advancements in prompting techniques, like\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts presented by Y u et al.\\n[36], further improve LLM performance in legal reasoning\\ntasks. LLMs are also explored for their potential in legal\\neducation and supporting legal professionals [37]. Research\\nby Iu Wong et al. [38] and Hargreaves [39] discusses the\\nethical utilization of AI in law school assessments, proposing\\nmethods to educate students on appropriate AI usage [40].\\nPettinato [41] suggests that LLMs could assist law professors\\nin administrative duties and streamline scholarly work.\\nMacey-Dare [42] investigates LLMs as quasi-expert legal\\nadvisors, showcasing their feasibility in providing affordable\\nlegal counsel. In summary, LLMs have exhibited promising\\noutcomes across diverse legal tasks, with advancements\\nin prompting techniques playing a pivotal role in their\\nefficacy. Nevertheless, challenges persist in ensuring the\\nethical utilization of LLMs and addressing their potential\\nimpact on the legal profession. Continued exploration of the\\ncapabilities and constraints of LLMs in the legal arena is\\nessential, while ensuring their alignment with human values\\nand societal requirements.\\nTo systematically categorize the tasks in the legal domain\\nwhere LLMs are applied, we adapted the structure proposed\\nby Greco et al. [3], which divides legal challenges into three\\nmain areas: Legal Search [18], Legal Document Review [43]\\nand Legal Prediction [17], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23],\\n[24], [25].\\nLegal Search encompasses the following tasks:\\n• Document Retrieval (T1): The process of finding\\nrelevant legal documents, such as case law, statutes,\\nor legal opinions, from a large corpus of texts [17],\\n[18], [44].\\n• Case Entailment (T2): Retrieving documents that log-\\nically follows from or are supported by another case\\n[18], [44].\\n• Question Answering (T3): Answering specific legal\\nquestions by retrieving and synthesizing information\\nfrom legal texts [18], [45].\\nLegal Document Review includes:\\n• Named Entity Recognition (T4): Identifying and clas-\\nsifying entities (e.g., names of people, organizations,\\nlocations) within legal documents [43].\\n• Similarity Estimation (T5): Measuring how similar two\\nlegal documents or cases are, which is essential for tasks\\nlike case law comparison [43], [46].\\n• Classification (T6): Categorizing legal documents into\\npredefined categories based on their content [24],\\n[46], [47].\\n• Document Summarization (T7): Producing concise sum-\\nmaries of lengthy legal documents [48], [49].\\n• Datasets and Benchmarking (T8): Creating and using\\ndatasets to evaluate and compare the performance of\\nvarious AI models in legal tasks [50].\\n• Document Automation (T9): Automating the review\\nand synthesis process of legal documents to enhance\\nefficiency and accuracy [51].\\nLegal Prediction consists of:\\n• Judgement Prediction (T10): Predicting the outcomes\\nof legal cases based on previous rulings and case\\ncharacteristics [19], [20], [21], [22], [52], [53].\\n• Next Sentence Prediction (T11): Predicting the subse-\\nquent sentence in a legal document to assist in drafting\\nand understanding legal texts [16], [17].\\nThese tasks represent the specific activities that LLMs\\nand other AI technologies perform within broader legal\\napplications, facilitating advancements in legal research,\\ndocument automation, and outcome prediction.\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18255'),\n",

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nIII. RESEARCH METHOD\\nIn conducting our systematic review, we adhered to the\\nPreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-\\nAnalyses (PRISMA) guidelines [54]. PRISMA is a widely\\naccepted standard designed to help researchers conduct and\\nreport systematic reviews and meta-analyses in a transparent\\nand comprehensive manner. It provides a checklist of items\\nthat should be included in the report of a systematic review\\nor meta-analysis, ensuring that the review is conducted\\nsystematically and that all relevant information is clearly\\npresented. By following the PRISMA guidelines, we aimed\\nto enhance the quality and reliability of our review. Our\\nmethodology included a thorough search strategy, rigorous\\nstudy selection criteria, systematic data collection, and\\ncomprehensive analysis. This approach ensured that our\\nfindings are robust and reproducible, providing a clear and\\ntransparent overview of the current state of LLMs in the\\nlegal domain. To identify relevant papers, we employed\\nan adaptation of PRISMA guidelines, including a database\\nsearch and complemented by the backward snowballing\\nprocedure [55], in order to reduce the risk of overlooking\\npertinent documents within the time frame selected. In the\\nfollowing subsections, we define the scope of the literature\\nreview through the research questions, the inclusion and\\nexclusion criteria, the search and selection procedure, and the\\nquality assessment criteria.\\nA. RESEARCH QUESTIONS\\nThe scope of our literature review is related to the application\\nof LLMs to the legal domain tailored to address both general\\nand specialized tasks within the realm of law, and it is defined\\nby the following Research Questions (RQs):\\n1) RQ1: What are the NLP applications in the legal\\ndomain that have already made use of LLMs?\\n2) RQ2: Is the pre-training or the fine-tuning of LLMs\\nspecifically for the legal domain always beneficial?\\nAnd in what cases and for what tasks?\\n3) RQ3: What are the main advantages and limitations of\\nLLMs in the legal field?\\n4) RQ4: What are the possible applications of LLMs to\\nthe legal domain not yet fully explored?\\nRQ1 serves as the overarching inquiry, aiming to identify\\nthe specific NLP tasks within the legal domain that have\\nemployed Transformer models. Building upon the initial\\nquestion, RQ2 seeks to determine whether the pre-training\\nof LLMs on general data, followed by fine-tuning them\\nspecifically for the legal domain, consistently yields ben-\\neficial outcomes in legal domains. Pre-training involves\\ntraining the model on a large corpus of diverse texts to\\ndevelop a broad understanding of language, while fine-\\ntuning adjusts the model’s parameters using a smaller,\\nspecialized dataset to improve its performance on specific\\ntasks within the legal field. RQ2 also seeks to identify\\nwhich of the NLP applications are currently viable for\\nuse in real-world legal settings. It involves assessing the\\nmaturity and performance of LLMs in these applications,\\nexamining case studies, pilot projects, and industry reports\\nto identify instances where LLMs are successfully being\\nused by legal professionals or institutions. Finally, RQ3 and\\nRQ4 aim to explore advantages and limitations of LLMs\\nin the legal domain, and legal tasks that have not yet been\\nextensively researched or implemented. They aim to identify\\ngaps in the current literature, brainstorming innovative uses\\nof LLMs, and proposing new areas where these models\\ncould significantly impact legal practices, such as novel ways\\nof automating legal processes, enhancing legal decision-\\nmaking, or improving access to legal resources.\\nOverall, these research questions follow a logical progres-\\nsion, starting with broad inquiries about the usage of LLMs\\nin the legal domain and gradually narrowing down to specific\\naspects and areas for improvement.\\nB. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA\\nThis subsection outlines the criteria used for assessing\\nthe relevance of the studies. We excluded all publications\\nmeeting any of the following criteria: (E1) studies unrelated\\nto applications or tools of LLMs in the legal domain,\\n(E2) non-English publications, (E3) non-research article\\ntypes (e.g., type magazine, secondary study, course material,\\ndoctoral symposium paper, thesis, position paper, keynote\\npresentation, abstract, or book chapter), (E4) inaccessible\\npublications, and (E5) gray literature sources (e.g. blogs,\\nmanuals, tutorials, newsletter or project reports). Conversely,\\nwe included publications meeting at least one of the following\\ncriteria: (I1) studies addressing applications of LLMs in law,\\nand (I2) relevant gray literature sources such as arXiv studies\\nthat fulfilled I1.\\nWe evaluated the relevance of the studies by exam-\\nining their titles, abstracts, and keywords. If the initial\\nassessment was inconclusive, we delved deeper into the\\narticle’s structure, introduction, methodology, results, and\\nconclusions. The initial screening process was carried out\\nby the first two authors. Any discrepancies or uncertainties\\nwere resolved through collaborative discussions among all\\nfour authors to achieve a consensus. It’s important to note\\nthat while conducting the search, surveys, or systematic\\nreviews emerged as results. Although these were assessed\\nfor relevance, they were included in the related section\\nonly if they aligned with our objectives, but they were not\\nincorporated into the comprehensive list of analysed articles.\\nC. SEARCH AND SELECTION PROCEDURE\\nThis subsection outlines the selection process. Regarding the\\ndatabase search, we selected a set of known repositories:\\nIEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, and\\nElsevier ScienceDirect, and we also complemented these\\nwith Google Scholar. Both searches were carried out during\\nthe last quarter of 2023. In order to refine the search,\\nwe formulated a combination of the following strings: Legal\\nAI, Legal NLP, NLP and Law, Case retrieval NLP and\\nContract review, between 2017 to 2023.\\n18256 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nIt is pertinent to mention that the chosen timeframe\\naligns with the emergence of pivotal advancements in NLP ,\\nparticularly marked by the introduction of the Transformer\\narchitecture [26] and the subsequent development of the\\nBERT model [56], which occurred between the years\\n2017 and 2019.\\nWe screened document titles and metadata to also apply the\\nsnowballing approach, and we removed duplicated records,\\nrecords that were not accessible, that weren’t applications\\nor were written in a non-English language.

QUALITY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA\\nThis section outlines the criteria utilized for assessing\\nthe quality of the included publications. We employed a\\nchecklist, as depicted in Table1, constructed based on criteria\\noutlined in the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) 1\\nand the methodology proposed in [57]. The questions in\\nTable 1 are sequentially organized from Q1 to Q5. For\\neach question, we devised sub-questions to facilitate the\\nevaluation process for each publication. These sub-questions\\nguided the assessment of publication quality, with responses\\ncategorized as either ‘yes’ or ‘no’, corresponding to values\\nof 1 and 0, respectively. If any sub-question under a main\\nquestion received a ‘yes’, the corresponding main question\\nwas also marked as ‘yes’. Additionally, we deemed Q1 as the\\nthreshold criterion for further quality assessment, requiring a\\npositive response to proceed.\\nTABLE 1. Questions of the quality assessment checklist.\\nIV. BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS\\nAfter the quality assessment, we carefully selected a set of\\npublications from which we were able to extract relevant data\\nto answer the research questions. The resulting list of studies\\nis composed of 61 publications, labelled as P1 to P61. 2 We\\nuse two types of references to ensure clarity and transparency.\\n1CASP Checklists, available at: https://casp-uk.net/casp-toolschecklists/\\n(Accessed: Dec. 28, 2024)\\n2The complete list of publications can be found at the following link:\\nhttps://github.com/marco-siino/llm-applications-ieee-access (Accessed:\\nDec. 28, 2024)\\nThe [ref number] citations refer to the standard bibliographic\\nentries listed at the end of the paper. Additionally, we use\\nPxx references to directly link to the publication details\\nas collected during our research. These Pxx references\\ncorrespond to the attached file containing all the selected\\npapers, allowing readers to easily find and verify the specific\\npublications discussed in our review. For example, P01 refers\\nto the first publication in the attached file, while [1] refers\\nto the first entry in the bibliography section. This dual\\nreferencing system aims to enhance the transparency and\\nreproducibility of our work, providing readers with easy\\naccess to the relevant publication information. We believe\\nthis approach strikes a balance between streamlining the\\nreading experience and maintaining the transparency and\\nreproducibility of our research.\\nIn this section we analyse the 61 selected publications\\nin terms of venue type, geographic distribution, and author\\naffiliation. These publications span from 2020 to 2023,\\nshowing a consistent upward trend in the amount of articles\\npublished each year regarding AI in the legal domain (10\\nstudies in 2020, 15 in 2021, 17 in 2022, and 19 in 2023).\\nA. DISTRIBUTION BY TYPE OF VENUE\\nThe majority of the selected publications were distributed\\nacross conferences (20 studies), workshops (13), and journals\\n(7). There were also two articles presented in a single\\nsymposium (JSAI International Symposium on Artificial\\nIntelligence) and one article in a forum (F orum for Infor-\\nmation Retrieval Evaluation). Additionally, we identified\\n18 pre-prints available on arXiv. Among the conferences,\\nthe most prominent were the International Conference on\\nArtificial Intelligence and Law (3 publications) and the\\nConference on Neural Information Processing Systems (3),\\nfollowed by 14 different conferences. In terms of workshops,\\nthe Natural Legal Language Processing Workshop led with\\nfour publications, followed by the Workshop on AI for Public\\nAdministration with two, alongside seven other workshops.\\nNotably, the dominant journal is Artificial Intelligence and\\nLaw, with four articles.\\nB. DISTRIBUTION BY AFFILIATION\\nWe identified 37 studies within a purely academic context,\\n10 associated with various industries (encompassing compa-\\nnies, institutes, centers, and government entities), and 14 with\\nshared affiliations.

It’s feasible to mention that the Case Law area\\nis mostly focused on court cases, including supreme court\\ncases, European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases,\\ncivil cases, European Court of Justice cases, and supporting\\ncases; showing interest in court decisions, opinions and\\nprecedents. In the Legislation area there is attention on\\nnational legislation, statutes, and civil law codes, with a\\nsignificant focus on EU law, US law, and UK law, although\\nalso appeared the exploration of Indian Law. Then, in Legal\\nDocuments, there is an emphasis on contracts and case\\njudgements, while there is also a notable interest in deal\\npoints, maxims and measures (e.g. COVID-19), and fewer\\nstudies showed interest on legal questions, legal news, and\\nonline legal resources.\\nTABLE 2.

MODELS AND APPROACHES\\nThe LLMs application in law encompass a wide range of\\nfunctionalities and objectives, such as contract review, legal\\nresearch, document automation, case prediction, and com-\\npliance monitoring, among others. Furthermore, we define\\napplication as particular cases of how a model, an algorithm,\\na tool, or others is applied to a legal task.\\nTo address the research questions, we approach legal\\nAI tasks in two ways. First, we examine each legal task\\nby reviewing the relevant studies, highlighting their key\\ncontributions, and identifying trends. Second, we summarize\\nthese tasks to offer valuable insights for the research\\ncommunity.\\nThe rest of this section presents the main contributions to\\nthe identified legal tasks, with a summary of the tasks and\\ncorresponding studies shown in Table 3.\\nTABLE 3. Distribution of legal tasks and studies.\\nA. LEGAL SEARCH\\n1) DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL (T1)\\nIn the legal domain, practitioners frequently require access\\nto specific documents for tasks such as research, case\\npreparation, drafting, and client advising. Document retrieval\\nis pivotal in accessing relevant legal texts, including court\\ncases, statutes, regulations, and legal opinions, to support\\nthese activities effectively [17], [18], [44].\\nAmong the articles reviewed, 15 focused on Document\\nRetrieval in the legal domain (P04-P10, P12-P16, P20, P28,\\nP37), with a primary focus on Case Law and Legislation\\n(see Table 2). In particular, 11 articles focus on Legal Case\\nRetrieval, one on Statute Law Retrieval (P09), and two\\non both Legal Case Retrieval and Statute Law Retrieval\\n(P06, P07). Notably, five articles specifically address long-\\ndocument retrieval (P06, P07, P10, P13, P28).\\nV arious tools, methods, frameworks, and language models\\nhave been proposed to enhance document retrieval. For\\ninstance, P05 [58] presents a Virtual Legal Assistant (VLA)\\nthat enables legal professionals to consult on legal situations\\nwith an AI-based assistant. The study emphasizes the\\nInformation Retrieval phase, refining search scope with\\nincreasing query intricacies and filters.\\nThe COLIEE competition 4 stands out in this research\\nfield. In P06 [59], a tool with specialized multilingual search\\nfunctionalities for document retrieval and entailment tasks\\nwas introduced. CatBoost was used for case law retrieval,\\nand pre-trained embeddings combined with TF-IDF (i.e.,\\nTerm Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) [60] were\\nemployed for statutory information retrieval. The preprocess-\\ning included lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and\\nnumeric digit-to-text conversion, with FastText for embed-\\nding training. Embedding-based methods proved to be more\\neffective than those based on TF-IDF. A knowledge-based\\napproach for legal document retrieval - relying on document\\nembedding also in this case - and based on the organization\\nof a textual data repository is introduced in [61]. Documents\\nthat have been pre-processed and embedded undergo iterative\\nsentence-level classification through a cycle of terminology\\nextraction and concept formation. This method leverages\\nthe ASKE (Automated System for Knowledge Extraction)\\nengine, which tackles a multilabel classification problem\\nwithout requiring any initial annotations of the documents.\\nThe authors present an application of ASKE in a practical\\ncase study focused on retrieving legal documents from a\\nrepository of Italian court decisions. This work is part of the\\nNext Generation UPP (NGUPP) project, funded by the Italian\\nMinistry of Justice, and aims to integrate AI and advanced\\ninformation management techniques to facilitate the digital\\ntransformation of Italian legal processes and digital justice.\\nSpecifically, the case study addresses a common challenge\\nfaced by legal practitioners and administrators: the retrieval\\nof past court decisions, known as ‘‘precedents,’’ based on one\\nor more input text fragments, such as sentences, definitions,\\nor excerpts from articles. The goal is to identify and retrieve\\nthe most relevant documents, such as court decisions or\\nspecific sentences within them, that match the input query.\\nSimilarly, P07 [62] addressed long documents and ambiguity\\nin the legal domain, proposing a document-level attention\\nmechanism and passage mining. They used abstract meaning\\nrepresentation to reduce noise and identified use-cases. The\\ndatasets comprised Canadian Federal Court cases and statute\\nlaw. LEGAL-BERT was utilized to extract semantic relation-\\nships, and Spacy for text segmentation. TF-IDF outperformed\\nBM25 in obtaining superior performance on long-document-\\nrelated tasks. Regarding long-document tasks, in P10 [63],\\ntwo methods for long-document processing were explored:\\nmodifying Longformer warm-started from LEGAL-BERT\\nfor longer texts (up to 8,192 tokens), and modifying\\n4Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE),\\navailable at https://sites.ualberta.ca/ rabelo/COLIEE2024/\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18259'),\n",

Experiments\\non LexGLUE showed these variants outperformed LEGAL-\\nBERT, establishing new state-of-the-art solutions. Opposite\\nthan TF-IDF, using embedding representation P08 [64]\\nintroduced a knowledge-based approach for retrieving prece-\\ndent sentences using document embedding models, with\\na zero-shot approach for classification and knowledge\\nextraction from text fragments. Furthermore, in P20 [65] the\\nauthors introduce a novel method named PRILJ, designed\\nto identify paragraph regularities in legal case judgments\\nand assist legal experts in drafting legal documents. PRILJ\\nemploys a two-step approach: first, it groups documents\\ninto clusters based on their semantic content, and then it\\nidentifies regularities within the paragraphs of each cluster.\\nThe method utilizes embedding techniques to represent\\ndocuments and paragraphs in a semantic numerical feature\\nspace. Additionally, an approximated nearest neighbor search\\nmethod is used to efficiently retrieve the most similar\\nparagraphs relative to those in a document being prepared.\\nAnother successful application of embedding representation\\nis reported in P13 [66]. It combined lexical and dense\\nretrieval methods for paragraph-level case retrieval. The\\nbest results were achieved with BM25 and dense passage\\nretrieval using domain-specific embeddings. BM25 was used\\nfor initial retrieval, followed by BERT for aggregation and\\nreordering. A BERT variation is discussed in P28 [67]\\nwhere the authors proposed BERT-PLI to model paragraph-\\nlevel interactions and infer relevance between cases, using\\na cascade framework to reduce computational costs. The\\nmodel was fine-tuned with a small-scale case law entailment\\ndataset, demonstrating effectiveness in legal scenarios. Also\\nbased upon BERT, P09 [68] focused on information retrieval\\nsystems to identify relevant precedents and statutes using text\\nsimilarity approaches.\\nDomain-specific adaptation of BERT are often accom-\\nplished pre-training or fine-tuning the original BERT model\\non specific domains. For instance, P12 [69] introduced\\nLamBERTa, a BERT-derived model pretrained on Italian\\nCivil Code laws, highlighting predictive justice. LamBERTa\\npredicts relevant articles from the Italian Civil Code in\\nfew-shot scenarios, emphasizing domain-specific adaptation.\\nP16 [70] revised LamBERTa, incorporating legal-specific\\npre-training and out-of-vocabulary legal terms. Extensive\\nevaluation revealed significant improvements in law article\\nretrieval due to domain- and task-adaptation.\\nSome variations of the original Transformer architecture\\nhave also been found in the literature. For example, P15\\n[71] introduced SAILER, a structure-aware pre-trained\\nlanguage model for legal case retrieval, integrating structural\\ninformation and an asymmetric encoder-decoder architec-\\nture. SAILER outperformed previous methods in legal\\ncase retrieval tasks, demonstrating strong discriminative\\ncapabilities.\\nFinally, in P14 [72], the authors evaluate 27 methods\\n(based on both Transformers and traditional architectures)\\non standard benchmarks derived from Open Case Book and\\nWiki source. The objective of the task is to retrieve relevant\\nliterature given a specific case. The methods assessed in the\\nstudy can be broadly categorized into three groups: word-\\nvector based, Transformer based and citations based.\\nWhat emerged from the review of the literature is that\\nperforming fine-tuning or pre-training on a Transformer-\\nbased architecture as BERT, or on a word embedding\\nrepresentations, is often beneficial and common in the\\nfield of article and case retrieval. Some exceptions are\\ntraditional approaches, as TF-IDF. However, we barely found\\nfoundational models able to outperform domain-specific\\nmodels and approaches for retrieval tasks.\\n2) CASE ENTAILMENT (T2)\\nCase Entailment is the task of determining whether the\\nfacts, legal principles and arguments introduced in a legal\\ncase logically support or imply the outcome of another\\ncase, requiring to analyse the content of legal documents\\nto identify relationships and inferring conclusions based on\\nprecedents [18], [44]. We have found 4 studies that focus on\\nthis task (P06, P07, P13, P28), and their main legal area of\\nthe application is Case Law.\\nIn P06 [59], out of 4 tasks, Task 2 (a case law\\nentailment task) aims to distinguish which paragraph in\\na supporting case implies the provided text fragment and\\nTask 4 (statutory entailment task) focuses on determining\\nthe potential implication of a bar exam question by a set of\\nrelevant articles. For Task 2, the jurisprudence implication\\ntask requires finding an implying paragraph from a case,\\ngiven a base case with a specified fragment f. Three groups\\nof features (traditional, embedding similarity, and Natural\\nLanguage Inference (NLI)) were used also in this case.\\nAn ensemble classifier (i.e., XGBoost) was employed, and for\\neach related case R, results were ranked based on the number\\nof paragraphs implying f. The best embedding results were\\nobtained with BERT. With this model and on this task, the\\nauthors achieved satisfactory results in the competition. The\\nTask 4, the statutory law implication task, on the other hand,\\ninvolves determining whether a legal bar exam question Q\\nis included in the text of a series of articles S1, S2, . . . SN\\nrelevant to Q. Implication means that Q is true or false based\\non the content of S1, S2, . . . SN. This objective was pursued\\nin two ways: using a BERT-XGBoost combination and\\nemploying legal embeddings with a Bi-GRU. An interesting\\nconsideration is the results achieved by operating directly\\non the Japanese language, which typically contains more\\ninformative tokens than their English counterparts [73], [74].\\nTheir findings illustrate that using legal embeddings and\\nauxiliary linguistic features, such as NLI, showed the most\\npromise for future improvements.\\nAlso in P13 [66] the authors took advantage of a domain-\\nfocused embedding. The authors detail their methodologies\\nfor two specific tasks in the COLIEE 2021 competition: legal\\ncase retrieval and legal case entailment. The objective of the\\n18260 VOLUME 13, 2025'),\n",

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nlegal case entailment task is to develop a system capable of\\nidentifying paragraphs within a relevant case that support\\nthe decision of a new, given case. In this task, a query\\nparagraph is provided along with candidate paragraphs from\\na legal case, and the system must pinpoint which candidate\\nparagraphs logically support the decision outlined in the\\nquery paragraph. The datasets used for training and testing\\ninclude cases from the Federal Court of Canada. To identify\\nthe entailing paragraphs p for a given query paragraph\\nq, the authors employ both lexical and semantic ranking\\ntechniques to rank the candidate paragraphs. They evaluate\\nthe performance of two approaches: BM25 and lawDPR.\\nThe most effective results were achieved by combining\\nBM25 with dense passage retrieval, utilizing domain-specific\\nembeddings to enhance accuracy.\\nIt is also worth reporting that for this task (i.e., entailment)\\nthe most recurrent approaches are based on domain-specific\\nembedding or BERT adaptation to the legal domain. Even\\nif the tasks related to entailment are not yet fully solved\\nin the literature, LLM-based approaches have consistently\\noutperformed traditional and statistical method. This is due\\nto their ability to identify contextual and semantic relations\\nbetween words.\\n3) QUESTION ANSWERING (T3)\\nThis task is focused on the application of NLP and machine\\nlearning techniques to automatically provide answers to\\nlegal queries, which involves understanding and interpreting\\ncomplex legal questions and retrieving or generating accurate\\nand relevant answers based on legal texts such as statutes,\\ncase law, regulations, and legal opinions [18], [45]. We have\\nfound two studies for this task (P49 and P53) which are\\nembedded within the Legal Research and Miscellaneous legal\\nareas.\\nUnderstanding legal texts presents a considerable chal-\\nlenge due to their extensive and intricate clauses, com-\\npounded by a scarcity of datasets annotated by experts.\\nTo tackle this issue, P37 [75] introduced the Merger\\nAgreement Understanding Dataset (MAUD), a reading\\ncomprehension dataset meticulously annotated by experts\\nbased on the American Bar Association’s 2021 Public Target\\nDeal Points Study. 5 With over 39,000 examples and more\\nthan 47,000 annotations, MAUD serves as a significant\\nresource. The authors assert that MAUD stands as the\\nsole expert-annotated merger agreement dataset, making\\nit an invaluable benchmark for both the legal profession\\nand the NLP community. Their fine-tuned LLMs displayed\\npromising performance, consistently outperforming random\\nchance on most questions.\\nIn P49 [76], a question-answering system is introduced\\nto address legal queries. Sparse vectors and embeddings are\\nemployed as input for a BERT-based answer ranking model.\\nThe distinction is made between factoid and non-factoid\\n5https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/about/committees/\\nmergers-and-acquisitions/deal-points/ (Accessed: Dec. 28, 2024)\\nquestions. The proposed model is designed to address legal\\nquestions across a wide range of legal domains. The system\\nselects and ranks answers using a combination of sparse\\nvector techniques like BM25 and dense vectors (semantic\\nembeddings). The answer selection process is conducted\\non a collection comprising over 100 million passages. The\\nsystem employs Query By Document (QBD) implemented\\nwith BM25 for sparse vector representation, and Legal GloV e\\nand Legal Siamese BERT for semantic embeddings. The\\nvalues on the answer evaluation scale serve as a threshold\\nto determine which answers to accept and which to reject.\\nMany of the solutions implemented in this study hold notable\\nrelevance and are of interest for future developments.\\nIn P53 [77], the authors introduce FRAQUE, a system\\ndesigned to answer factual questions within the Public\\nAdministration sector. This system utilizes semantic frames,\\nwhich are structured collections of slots with defined possible\\nvalues. FRAQUE operates by querying unstructured data\\nfrom various sources such as documents, websites, and\\nsocial media. Leveraging statistical components like word\\nembeddings, the system offers flexibility in adapting to\\ndifferent domains and languages. The primary objective of\\nFRAQUE is to match questions with relevant frames and\\ncorresponding document passages stored in a knowledge\\ngraph, which are then presented as answers. To ensure\\nuser-friendliness, FRAQUE’s development follows a user-\\ncentered design approach, allowing for the monitoring of\\nlinguistic patterns used by users and identifying the most\\nfrequently occurring structures in their queries.\\nBoth P49 [76] and P53 [77] highlight the importance of\\ndeveloping question-answering systems for legal and public\\nadministration domains. The use of sparse vector techniques\\nlike BM25 and dense vectors (semantic embeddings) in P49\\nand pattern-based systems in P53, have shown promising\\nresults in addressing legal and factoid questions, respectively.\\nThe user-centred design process employed in P53 ensures the\\nsystem’s usability and adaptability to different domains and\\nlanguages. Overall, the development of such systems has the\\npotential to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy\\nof legal and public administration processes.\\nB. LEGAL DOCUMENT REVIEW\\n1) NAMED ENTITY RECOGNITION (T4)\\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial stage in many\\nlegal AI tasks, facilitating the organization of unstructured\\ntext data into a more structured and searchable format [43].\\nWe reviewed 16 studies that contribute to the advancement\\nof NER in the legal domain. These studies encompass the\\nintroduction of new datasets, development of NER systems,\\ncreation of language models, evaluation of models, and\\nproposition of legal annotation procedures. The primary\\nfocus of these studies is Case Law, although other legal areas\\nare also covered.\\nSeveral studies have introduced new datasets for NER.\\nThese include a dataset comprised of German federal court\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18261'),\n",

Another dataset, CUAD, was curated\\nfor legal contract review (P35 [79]), with experiments con-\\nducted using Transformer-based architectures such as BERT,\\nRoBERTa, AlBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, MAUD,\\na dataset based on the 2021 American bar examination, was\\npresented in (P37) [75]. P42 utilized a publicly available\\nlegal NER dataset (ENER), with a subset of filings extracted\\nfor training different NER algorithms on the general English\\nCoNLL-2003 corpus.\\nIn terms of NER system development, P36 [80] presented\\na system within the Romanian legal domain. The authors\\ncurated a manually annotated corpus, MARCELL-RO, which\\nencompasses legal documents extracted from the extensive\\nMARCELL project.\\nRegarding language models, P38 [81] introduced LEGAL-\\nBERT, a family of language models adapted to the specific\\nlegal domain through domain-specific pre-training or trained\\nfrom scratch. The performances achieved were superior\\nto using BERT-base. The same study introduced LEGAL-\\nBERT-SMALL, with experiments conducted on several\\ndatasets, including one for NER focused on USA contracts.\\nP39 [82] extended the base vocabulary of the Italian\\nTransformer model UmBERTo, resulting in BureauBERTo,\\nthrough further pre-training on a corpus of documents\\nrelated to the Italian Public Administration, banking, and\\ninsurance sectors. Two evaluation strategies were employed:\\nan intrinsic strategy involving predicting masked words\\nwithin the sequence, and an extrinsic approach involving\\na specific NER task tailored to the Public Administration\\ndomain. Also related to the Italian domain, in P41 [83], the\\nauthors evaluated NER tasks using ITALIAN BERT+ Spacy\\nNER and ITALIAN-LEGAL-BERT + Spacy NER. For the\\nsemantic similarity task, a subset of sentences from the Italian\\nCivil Law DB was utilized.\\nA novel architectural approach based on a hierarchical\\nBi-LSTM was proposed in P40 [84], with the SemEval\\ntask encompassing three subtasks: RR Prediction, L-NER,\\nand CJPE. The proposed model, HLBERT-CRF, incorporates\\nboth word-level and sentence-level encoders. For tokeniza-\\ntion, a LEGAL-BERT-compatible tokenizer was employed,\\nand F1-score and weighted F1 were used as evaluation\\nmetrics.\\nP42 [85] tested various NER algorithms on the CONLL-\\n2001 corpus and evaluated them using the provided dataset\\ncollection. The paper also describes the E-NER corpus,\\nan annotated collection of legal documents. It contains\\ndetailed annotations for entities like case numbers, court\\nnames, statutes, and legal parties, making it a valuable\\nresource for training models that can accurately extract criti-\\ncal information from complex legal texts, streamlining tasks\\nsuch as case law research and contract analysis. In P44 [86],\\na comparison was made among five Transformers pretrained\\non general-purpose text for two tasks within the domain\\nof Public Administration in Italy: NER and Multi-Label\\nDocument Classification. The experimental results revealed\\nthat UmBERTo outperformed other Transformers for both\\ntasks. The Transformers considered were BERT-BASE-\\nITA, UmBERTo, Multilingual BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and\\nGePpeTto, the latter being the first autoregressive Italian\\nlanguage model built upon GPT-2. Furthermore, the authors\\nintroduced a novel dataset specifically for this task, derived\\nfrom a corpus they constructed, named the ‘‘A TTO’’ Corpus.\\nThe results consistently demonstrated UmBERTo’s superior\\nperformance across various tasks and dataset variants.\\nIn conclusion, the recent studies reviewed in this section\\nhave provided significant contributions to the advancement\\nof NER in the legal domain. The introduction of new\\ndatasets, such as those comprised of German federal court\\ndecisions, CUAD, MAUD, and E-NER, has expanded the\\nresources available for training and evaluating NER models.\\nThe development of NER systems, like the one presented in\\nP36 [80], has improved the accuracy and efficiency of entity\\nrecognition within legal documents. The creation of language\\nmodels, such as LEGAL-BERT and BureauBERTo, has\\nfurther enhanced the performance of NER tasks by adapting\\nto the specific legal domain and extending base vocabularies.\\nThe evaluation of these models has demonstrated their supe-\\nriority over general-purpose language models in handling\\nlegal text. Moreover, the proposition of novel architectural\\napproaches, like the hierarchical Bi-LSTM in P40 [84],\\nhas opened new avenues for improving the structural\\nunderstanding of legal documents. The comparison of various\\nTransformer models in P44 [86] has also highlighted the\\neffectiveness of domain-specific models, such as UmBERTo,\\nin handling legal NER tasks.\\nHowever, despite these advancements, challenges remain.\\nThe complexity and variability of legal language, as well\\nas the need for large annotated corpora, continue to pose\\nobstacles. Future research should focus on addressing\\nthese challenges, further improving the performance and\\napplicability of NER in the legal domain.\\n2) SIMILARITY ESTIMATION (T5)\\nIn the context of legal AI, this tasks focus on measuring how\\nclosely related or alike two pieces of legal text are, which\\ncan be comprised of comparisons between various types of\\nlegal documents such as court cases, statutes, contracts and\\nlegal opinions [43], [46]. We have identified 8 studies that\\napproach this task (P04, P05, P09, P11, P12, P19, P20, P33),\\nand most of the studies are embedded within the Case Law\\nand Legislation areas.\\nOne common theme among these studies is the impor-\\ntance of domain-specific pretraining and the use of text\\nsimilarity techniques. In P04 [23], the authors introduced\\na dataset called CaseHOLD and evaluated the performance\\nof different models on it.

We identified 6 studies (P03, P13,\\nP27, P58, P59, P60) that have considered this task, and all of\\nthem are focused on Case Law as legal area.\\nA recent study - P03 [89] - presented LBOX OPEN, a legal\\ncorpus with Korean precedents, along with a summarization\\ntask consisting of Supreme Court precedents and their\\ncorresponding summaries. Another study - P58 [83] -\\nintroduced a system for extracting legal holdings from Italian\\njudgments. The problem was modelled as a summarization\\ntask, with a focus on identifying salient passages. The authors\\ncurated a new dataset, ITA-CaseHold, containing over 1,100\\npairs of judgments and their corresponding holdings. The\\nauthors fine-tuned Italian-LEGAL-BERT-SC to predict the\\nmost relevant sentences within a document, and the proposed\\nmodel outperformed other baseline models in terms of Rouge\\nR-1 and R-2 metrics.\\nP59 [94] addressed the Civil Rights Litigation Clearing-\\nhouse (CRLC) and introduced Multi-LexSum, a collection\\nof 9,280 summaries authored by domain experts and derived\\nfrom CRLC documents. The authors demonstrated that state-\\nof-the-art models performed inadequately on this dataset. The\\nauthors employed the best-performing Transformers for sum-\\nmary generation, including BART, PEGASUS, PRIMERA,\\nand LED. However, human evaluation of the generated\\nsummaries revealed an average modification of 87 tokens per\\nparagraph, 76% paragraph length modification, and 65% total\\nlength modification, highlighting the unsatisfactory perfor-\\nmance of all the Transformers considered in comparison to\\nexpert-authored summaries.\\nTo address the challenge of limited data annotated by\\nexperts, P60 [95] introduced extractive summarization tech-\\nniques for legal decisions in a low-resource environment. The\\ndataset consisted of 112 decisions and their corresponding\\nexpert-annotated summaries. The authors leveraged Legal-\\nBERT, pre-trained on Harvard’s legal case corpus, and pro-\\nposed a multitask model to distinguish Reasoning/Evidence\\nfrom other rhetorical roles. Comparative baselines included\\nMMR and TextRank, and evaluation metrics encompassed\\nROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2.\\nIn conclusion, the studies discussed in this paragraph\\nhighlight the potential of NLP techniques for summarizing\\nlegal documents. However, the results also indicate that there\\nis still room for improvement in terms of summary quality\\nand accuracy, particularly in low-resource environments and\\nfor complex legal documents. The use of domain-specific pre-\\ntrained models, such as LEGAL-BERT, and the creation of\\nnew datasets, such as ITA-CaseHold and Multi-LexSum, are\\nimportant steps towards improving the performance of NLP\\ntechniques in summarizing legal documents.\\n5) DATASETS AND BENCHMARKING (T8)\\nDatasets and Benchmarking help to measure and compare\\nthe performance of AI models in the legal domain, and also\\nfoster the creation of new datasets that can become available\\nfor the community; these are crucial elements for advancing\\nresearch, development, and application of AI technologies in\\nlegal contexts [50]. We have found 15 studies that focused\\non this field, most of them introducing new datasets (P02,\\nP03, P04, P17, P21, P22, P23, P32, P34, P35), proposing new\\nbenchmarks (P24, P56,), new benchmark datasets (P14, P18,\\nP58) or new corpus (P61). Table 4) summarized the datasets\\nintroduced that can be categorized as court cases (P02, P14,\\nP32), court precedents (P03), and various legal documents\\nsuch as holdings (P04), contracts (P17, P22, P35), and facts\\nfrom ECHR rulings (P21, P56).\\nAdditionally, there is a strong emphasis on developing\\nbenchmarks for court precedents, case names, statutes, and\\nvarious types of legal decisions (P03, P24, P58). Contract\\nreview is another area of interest, with studies focusing\\non analysing contract terms and conditions (P18, P35).\\nFurthermore, NER datasets are being created to improve\\nthe extraction of information from court decisions (P34\\n[78]). The trend also includes benchmarking legal texts\\nusing support vector machine classifiers on the LexGLUE\\ndataset, which encompasses facts from ECtHR rulings, court\\nopinions, and online terms of service (P56 [96]). Overall,\\nthese trends underscore the critical role of creating and\\nevaluating new datasets and benchmarks to advance the\\ncapabilities of legal AI in handling diverse legal documents.\\nThe performance and effectiveness of LLMs in legal\\ndomain are evaluated using a combination of standardized\\nbenchmarks and custom criteria tailored for the legal domain.\\nStandardized benchmarks such as LexGLUE and CUAD\\nprovide a robust framework for comparing the performance\\nof different LLMs across various legal NLP tasks.

The study confirms that due to the token length\\nlimitations of Transformers, they may not always be the\\nmost effective choice. The best results in both datasets were\\nachieved through a hybrid combination of FastTextLegal and\\nPoincaré.\\nIn P34 [78], the authors introduced a dataset for NER\\nspecifically tailored to decisions from the German Federal\\nCourt. The dataset comprises approximately 67,000 sen-\\ntences with over 2 million tokens. It includes 54,000 manually\\nannotated entities, categorized into 19 detailed semantic\\nclasses.

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nAnother language-specific model is presented in P32 [52],\\nwhich introduced a Romanian BERT model pre-trained on a\\nlarge specialized corpus. The authors claimed that their model\\noutperforms several strong baselines for legal judgement\\nprediction on two different corpora, consisting of cases\\nfrom trials involving banks in Romania. Also in this study,\\nthe beneficial effect of the domain-specific pre-training is\\nsupported by the results.\\nIn another domain, P03 [89] presented LBOX OPEN,\\nwhich is a large-scale benchmark of Korean legal AI\\ndatasets. The legal judgment prediction tasks include 10,500\\ncriminal cases, where the model predicts fine amounts and\\nimprisonment types based on the facts, and 4,700 civil cases,\\nwhere the model predicts the degree of claim acceptance\\nfrom the facts and claims for relief. The authors introduced\\nLCUBE, an LLM pretrained on the newly created corpus,\\nbased on the GPT-2 architecture. The authors highlight their\\nresult, showing that for more difficult tasks, pre-training\\nfrom scratch is more helpful than domain adaptation using\\nfine-tuning.\\nMoreover, P50 [102] concentrated on predicting cases with\\nnegative outcomes instead of predicting only the case of\\npositive outcomes. The authors made their entire codebase\\navailable on GitHub and introduced two probabilistic models\\nto address this challenge. The set of random variables used\\nrelates to the article associated with a positive, negative,\\nor null outcome. Another random variable encodes whether a\\nparticular article has been cited or not, and a random variable\\nis employed to represent the textual description of the facts.\\nThe first model they propose (Joint Model) assumes that the\\ntwo former random variables are conditionally independent\\nregarding the i-th article. Furthermore, both variables solely\\ndepend on the facts. The second model presented (Claim-\\nOutcome Model) is based on the probability that, given the\\nfacts, articles are chosen first, followed by the prediction of\\na specific outcome. The ECHR was used as the validation\\ncorpus, utilizing the golden labels provided in [50]. The\\noutcome corpus was generated from this source. The results\\nshow that while a basic BERT-based classification model\\ncan predict positive outcomes with an F1 score of 75.06,\\nit only achieves an F1 score of 10.09 for negative outcomes,\\nperforming below a random baseline, which reaches an F1\\nscore of 11.12.\\nFinally, P52 [103] implemented four ML models for\\nsentence prediction on the dataset of the ECHR. The\\nauthors investigated the impacts on performance concerning\\na) metrics, b) the inclusion of various combinations of\\nparts of the considered case, c) the effect of more or\\nless domain-specialized architectures, and d) the temporal\\neffect of past decisions available. The dataset has been\\noccasionally adapted for the Article Classification and Binary\\nClassification tasks. For the former, there are 9 DSs for\\neach article. The evaluation metrics used are Accuracy and\\nMCC. The authors noted that the use of MCC as a metric\\nsignificantly reframes the expectations and actual results\\nof state-of-the-art models applied to the legal domain. The\\nresults showed that the Facts section plays a key role in Court\\nCase Predictions. Also, a generalist model trained on all\\narticles performs better than a specialized ensemble model.\\nAdditionally, predicting future events based on past cases is\\nmore difficult than using a mix of past and future cases for\\ntraining.\\nIn conclusion, with regard to this task, there are still\\nchallenges to be addressed, such as the inherent imbalance\\nin legal datasets and the difficulty in predicting negative\\noutcomes. Especially in this area, the language-specific\\ntrained models have proved to be the elective choice for state-\\nof-the-art results in judgement prediction.\\n2) NEXT SENTENCE PREDICTION (T11)\\nNext Sentence Prediction using Transformer models like\\nBERT in legal AI offers promising advancements in automat-\\ning and enhancing the understanding of legal texts. By lever-\\naging the capabilities of these models, legal professionals\\ncan improve the efficiency and accuracy of legal document\\ndrafting, research, and analysis. With regard to next sentence\\nprediction, we have identified 4 studies that contribute to this\\ntask (P39, P41, P42, P48), addressing Miscellaneous, Legal\\nResearch, Legal Documents and Case Law, respectively (see\\nTable 2).\\nIn P39 [82], the authors introduce BureauBERTo,\\nan enhanced version of the Italian Transformer model\\nUmBERTo. By performing additional pre-training using\\na corpus of documents related to public administration,\\nbanking, and insurance, they expanded UmBERTo’s base\\nvocabulary. This training methodology underscores the\\nunique characteristics of Italian administrative jargon, which\\nextensively uses domain-specific terms (e.g., ‘ ‘ravvedimento\\noperoso’ ’ and ‘ ‘imponibile’ ’). Leveraging databases from\\nthe SEMPLICE 9 and ABI2LE 10 projects, the additional\\npre-training improved performance on proposed tasks,\\ndemonstrating BureauBERTo’s efficacy for legal applications\\nin the public administration sector.\\nAlso in the Italian legal domain, P41 [104] addresses\\nthe limitations of using Transformers pre-trained on general\\ncorpora like Wikipedia. Given the cryptic nature of legal\\nlanguage and the prevalence of Latin-based terms and archaic\\nterminology, the authors performed additional pre-training on\\nthe Italian Civil Code.

TECHNOLOGIES: TRENDS WITHIN LEGAL TASKS AND\\nREAL-LIFE IMPLEMENTATIONS\\nA. TRENDS\\nAs part of the analysis and across various legal NLP\\ntasks, we identified that Transformer models such as BERT,\\nLEGAL-BERT, RoBERTa, and their variants are the predom-\\ninant technologies driving advancements. These models are\\nextensively used for tasks including judgement prediction,\\ndocument retrieval, classification, and NER. A table to\\nsummarize the content of this section is shown in the\\nTable 5.\\nThere is a noticeable trend towards domain-specific\\nadaptations of these Transformers, like LEGAL-BERT and\\nLamBERTa, which are fine-tuned to handle the unique\\ncomplexities of legal language and documents. Additionally,\\nthe integration of traditional models and embeddings, such\\nas SVM, BM25, GloV e, and Doc2V ec, with Transformers\\nindicates a hybrid approach where conventional methods\\ncomplement the capabilities of newer, more sophisticated\\nmodels. Another significant trend is the increasing use of\\nLLMs like ChatGPT and Vicuna for tasks such as contract\\nreview and automation. This demonstrates the evolving\\nlandscape where these powerful models are being leveraged\\nto handle more complex and nuanced legal tasks, providing\\nmore comprehensive and contextually accurate outputs.\\nThe development and benchmarking of multilingual and\\nmulti-label datasets also highlight the growing emphasis on\\ncreating more inclusive and versatile models that can perform\\nacross different legal systems and languages. Overall, the\\nintegration of advanced Transformer models with traditional\\ntechniques and the adaptation of LLMs for specific legal tasks\\nare shaping the future of legal NLP technologies.\\nIn particular, in Document Retrieval, authors have been\\ncombining traditional retrieval methods with Transformers\\nand integrating similarity detection techniques. Key tech-\\nnologies employed include BERT, Sentence-BERT, LEGAL-\\nBERT, BM25, GloV e, Doc2V ec, CatBoost, TF-IDF, and\\nLongformer (e.g., P04, P06, P10). This hybrid approach\\nleverages the strengths of both traditional and modern\\nmethods to enhance the accuracy and relevance of retrieved\\ndocuments [106].\\nFor Question Answering, BM25, Legal GloV e, and Legal\\nSiamese BERT are commonly used to develop systems tai-\\nlored for legal queries, leveraging embeddings and traditional\\nretrieval methods to improve performance (e.g., P49, P53).\\nThese techniques aim to accurately understand and respond\\nto complex legal questions.\\nRegarding Named Entity Recognition, combining sequence\\nmodels with Transformers and performing domain adaptation\\nfor specific legal systems has been proved to be effec-\\ntive. Technologies like BERT, LEGAL-BERT, RoBERTa,\\nDeBERTa, Bi-LSTM, CRF, BureauBERTo, and UmBERTo\\nare employed to enhance entity recognition in legal texts (e.g.,\\nP34, P35, P36).\\nMoreover, Similarity Detection has seen the use of\\nenhanced embeddings for legal text and the integration\\nof text and network-based similarity measures. Frequently\\nused technologies include BERT, LEGAL-BERT, RoBERTa,\\nSentence-BERT, GloV e, Doc2V ec, and TF-IDF (e.g., P09,\\nP11, P33). These methods improve the identification of\\nsimilar legal documents and cases.\\nAlso, in Classification extensive use of Transformer\\nmodels, along with traditional classifiers for baseline compar-\\nisons, is evident. Popular technologies are BERT, LEGAL-\\nBERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa, Longformer, SVM, CNN,\\nLSTM, and Bi-LSTM (e.g., P21, P26, P55). This combination\\nensures robust classification performance across various legal\\ntexts.\\nFor Document Summarization BERT, PEGASUS, BART,\\nLED, and PRIMERA are utilized for both extractive and\\nabstractive summarization techniques, along with multitask\\nlearning approaches (e.g., P03, P60, P59). These technologies\\nhelp generate concise and informative summaries of lengthy\\nlegal documents.\\nDatasets and Benchmarking efforts have focused on\\ncreating multilingual and multi-label datasets, evaluating pre-\\ntrained models on legal data. Technologies such as BERT,\\nRoBERTa, DeBERTa, Longformer, MiniLM, DistilBERT,\\nmDeBERTa-V3, and XML-R are frequently used (e.g., P21,\\nP22, P23). These datasets and benchmarks are crucial for\\nadvancing legal NLP research.\\nLikewise, in Document Review and Automation leveraging\\nLLMs models for contract drafting and automation, along\\nwith creating domain-specific BERT extensions, is common.\\nTechnologies like Vicuna, ChatGPT, Span NLI BERT, and\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18269'),\n",

CONCLUSION\\nIn this work, we have explored recent applications of LLMs\\nmodels to the legal domain. After performing a detailed\\nreview of the recent literature, we formulated four research\\nquestions. According to all the works discussed in the\\nprevious sections, here we conclude our work listing our main\\nfindings and mentioning the specific RQs formulated in the\\nSection I and answered here.\\nA. (RQ1) WHAT ARE THE NLP APPLICATIONS IN THE\\nLEGAL DOMAIN THAT HAVE ALREADY MADE USE OF\\nLLMS?\\n1) LEGAL SEARCH IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF LEGAL\\nRESEARCH AND PRACTICE\\nThe studies highlight the importance of document retrieval,\\ncase entailment and question answering in facilitating legal\\nresearch, case preparation, document drafting, and client\\nadvice. The legal domain is characterized by a vast amount\\nof unstructured and semi-structured information, making\\nefficient document retrieval crucial for legal professionals\\nto make informed decisions. The majority of the studies\\nare mainly focused on case law retrieval, demonstrating its\\nsignificance in the legal domain. Case law retrieval involves\\nidentifying relevant precedents and previous judgments to\\ninform current legal decisions. The complexity of this task\\nlies in capturing the nuances of legal language and the context\\nin which legal cases are presented.\\n2) REAL-WORLD DATASETS ARE REQUIRED FOR TRAINING\\nAND EVALUATING LEGAL DOCUMENT RETRIEVAL MODELS\\nThe studies relied on real-world datasets, such as LexGLUE,\\nCaseHOLD, and EUR-Lex, to train and evaluate their models.\\nReal-world datasets provide a realistic representation of\\nthe complexities and nuances of legal language, enabling\\nmodels to learn from practical applications. Datasets and\\nbenchmarking enable the assessment of model performance\\n17https://ascent.ai/ (Accessed: Dec. 28, 2024)\\n18https://www.compliance.ai/ (Accessed: Dec. 28, 2024)\\nto improve the performance of AI tools on various legal tasks.\\nStudies have introduced important datasets like LexGLUE\\nfor NLP tasks, CUAD for contract review, and MAUD for\\nmerger agreements. These efforts underscore the importance\\nof curated datasets and benchmarking in enhancing the\\ncapabilities of legal AI across different types of legal\\ndocuments and tasks.\\nB. (RQ2) IS THE PRE-TRAINING OR THE FINE-TUNING OF\\nLLMS SPECIFICALL Y FOR THE LEGAL DOMAIN ALWA YS\\nBENEFICIAL? AND IN WHAT CASES AND FOR WHAT\\nTASKS?\\n1) DOCUMENT EMBEDDING MODELS ARE OFTEN\\nEMPLOYED FOR CAPTURING SEMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS IN\\nLEGAL DOCUMENTS\\nThe studies highlighted the importance of document embed-\\nding models in capturing semantic relationships between\\ndocuments and retrieving relevant information. These models\\ncan learn to represent legal documents as dense vectors,\\nenabling efficient comparison and retrieval in terms of\\ndistance in vector space. According to several studies, word\\nembeddings trained from scratch are able to outperform\\npre-trained embedding and traditional approaches as TF-\\nIDF. Thanks to the word embedding, the studies highlight\\nthe potential of text similarity, document clustering, and\\ntopic modelling techniques for legal document analysis.\\nThe proposed methods have shown promising results in\\nimproving the performance of legal document analysis\\ntasks, such as law article retrieval, case retrieval, and topic\\nmodelling.\\n2) TASK-SPECIFIC MODELS USUALLY OUTPERFORM\\nGENERAL-DOMAIN PRE-TRAINED MODELS ON LEGAL\\nDOCUMENT RETRIEVAL TASKS\\nLegal texts often contain synonyms and specialized jargon,\\nwhich can affect similarity results. The current approaches\\ninclude several mechanisms to handle these aspects effec-\\ntively. Pre-trained language models like BERT, Sentence-\\nBERT, and LEGAL-BERT capture semantic relationships\\nand understand context, helping to recognize synonyms and\\ninterpret jargon accurately. Domain-specific fine-tuning fur-\\nther enhances these models’ ability to understand legal terms.\\nEmbedding techniques such as GloV e and Doc2V ec generate\\nword and document embeddings that capture semantic\\nsimilarities. Additionally, some approaches incorporate legal\\nsynonym dictionaries and ontologies to map different terms\\nto their standardized forms. Contextual analysis, combined\\nwith models like BM25 and TF-IDF, helps in handling the\\nvariability in legal language by considering the context in\\nwhich terms appear. The studies emphasized the importance\\nof domain adaptation for legal tasks, including fine-tuning\\npre-trained models on legal datasets or using domain-\\nspecific knowledge graphs. This approach enables models\\nto learn from the specific characteristics of legal language\\nand adapt to the unique challenges of the legal domain.\\nVOLUME 13, 2025 18271'),\n",

Siino et al.: Exploring LLMs Applications in Law: A Literature Review\\nSeveral studies demonstrated that task-specific models, such\\nas SAILER, LEGAL-BERT and LamBERTa, can outperform\\ngeneral-domain pre-trained models like BERT on specific\\ntasks like legal case retrieval. This suggests that domain\\nadaptation is crucial, as task-specific models can learn to\\ncapture the nuances of legal language and context. Even\\nif some tasks (e.g. entailment) are not yet fully solved\\nin the literature. LLM-based approaches have consistently\\noutperformed traditional and statistical method, due to their\\nability to comprehend contextual and semantic relations\\nbetween words.\\nC. (RQ3) WHAT ARE THE MAIN ADVANTAGES AND\\nLIMITATIONS OF LLMS IN THE LEGAL FIELD?\\nLong-Document Retrieval Presents a Unique Challenge in\\nLegal Document Retrieval. Despite progress made in legal\\ndocument retrieval, there are still several open challenges\\nthat require further research attention. These include handling\\nambiguity in legal language, dealing with irrelevant or\\nredundant information, and improving model interpretability.\\nThe increasing complexity of legal documents and the need\\nfor efficient retrieval methods highlight the importance of\\ndeveloping novel approaches to long-document retrieval.\\nThis may involve leveraging advancements in NLP , informa-\\ntion retrieval, or machine learning techniques to overcome\\nthe limitations. Five studies specifically addressed long-\\ndocument retrieval, emphasizing the need for efficient and\\neffective methods to retrieve relevant information from\\nlengthy documents. Long documents often require novel\\napproaches to capture the semantic relationships between\\ndocuments and retrieve relevant information. Unfortunately,\\nit is evident from the literature [107] that performance might\\nsuffer greatly when essential information is moved within\\nlong context, suggesting that language models as they exist\\ntoday are not able to effectively utilize information in lengthy\\ninput scenarios. The results indicate that there is still room\\nfor improvement in terms of summary quality and accuracy,\\nparticularly in low-resource environments and for long legal\\ndocuments. The use of domain-specific pre-trained models,\\nsuch as LEGAL-BERT, and the creation of new datasets,\\nsuch as ITA-CaseHold and Multi-LexSum, are important\\nsteps towards improving the performance of NLP techniques\\nin summarizing legal documents. However, they do not yet\\nfully solve the issues related to the understanding of long\\ndocuments (RQ3).\\nD. (RQ4) WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS OF\\nLLMS TO THE LEGAL DOMAIN NOT YET FULL Y EXPLORED?\\nFinally, there is a growing interest in the field of prompt\\nengineering for interacting with LLMs [7], [108], [109]\\n(RQ4). We argue that future applications will be mainly\\nbased on human-centered techniques [110], [111]. All of\\nthese techniques are usually based on zero-shot and few-\\nshot prompting, and more generically on the concept of\\nIn-Context Learning (ICL) [112]. In the case of LLM, ICL\\nrefers to the model’s ability to generate answers or perform\\ntasks based on examples provided within the input prompt,\\nwithout updating its internal parameters, by leveraging the\\ncontextual information to generate appropriate and desired\\noutputs. Crucially, there’s no need to adjust the model\\nparameters for the new assignment. The work on pre-trained\\nbig language models, which are capable of performing ICL\\nwithout requiring retraining, has popularized ICL. It may\\nbe expected that similar approaches will also be further\\nemployed in the legal domain to interact in a Q&A manner\\nwith the LLMs to accomplish legal tasks without further\\npre-training.\\nVIII. FUTURE DIRECTIONS\\nBased on the findings and analysis presented in our survey\\npaper on the application of LLMs in the legal domain,\\nin this section we propose the following future directions and\\nsuggestions to advance the field.\\nA. ENHANCED DATASET DIVERSITY AND QUALITY\\nDevelopment of Multilingual Datasets. Future research\\nshould focus on creating and curating multilingual datasets to\\nsupport the development of LLMs that can handle legal texts\\nin various languages. This will enhance the applicability of\\nthese models in global legal contexts. Inclusion of Diverse\\nLegal Subdomains. Efforts should be made to include\\ndatasets from diverse legal subdomains, such as intellectual\\nproperty, environmental law, and international law, to ensure\\nthat LLMs can generalize well across different areas of law.\\nB. ADVANCED MODEL ARCHITECTURES\\nHybrid Models. Explore the integration of LLMs with other\\nAI techniques, such as rule-based systems and knowledge\\ngraphs, to create hybrid models that leverage the strengths\\nof different approaches. Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning. Fur-\\nther investigate advanced fine-tuning techniques tailored to\\nspecific legal tasks, such as contract analysis, legal research,\\nand case outcome prediction, to improve the performance and\\naccuracy of LLMs in these areas.\\nC. ETHICAL AND LEGAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nBias and Fairness. Conduct studies to identify and mitigate\\nbiases in LLMs used for legal tasks. This includes developing\\nmethods to ensure fairness and transparency in model\\npredictions and decisions. Data Privacy and Security.\\nAddress data privacy and security concerns associated with\\nthe use of LLMs in legal applications. This may involve\\ndeveloping secure data handling protocols and ensuring\\ncompliance with relevant data protection regulations.\\nD. INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION\\nLegal Expertise Integration. Foster collaboration between\\nAI researchers and legal experts to ensure that the devel-\\nopment and deployment of LLMs in the legal domain are\\ninformed by practical legal knowledge and insights.

On the other hand, Agentic AI\\nsystems are designed to work on complex goals that have yet\\nto be structured and can be defined in a broad context.\\nAs shown in Table 3, traditional agents excel in structured\\ntasks but lack the flexibility required for adaptive, goal-\\noriented tasks in complex environments. Agentic AI advances\\nthese systems by introducing a high degree of autonomy'),\n",
